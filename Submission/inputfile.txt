All

or
=
23
weeks
at
the
University
of
Vermont
in
1995
(
n
=
2395
)
were
retrospectively
analyzed
for
delivery
route
,
indication
for
cesarean
,
gestational
age
,
parity
,
and
practice
group
(
to
reflect
risk
status
)

The
total
cesarean
rate
was
14.4
%
(
344
of
2395
)
,
and
the
primary
rate
was
11.4
%
(
244
of
2144
)

Abnormal
presentation
was
the
most
common
indication
(
25.6
%
,
88
of
344
)

The
``
corrected
''
cesarean
rate
(
maternal-fetal
medicine
and
transported
patients
excluded
)
was
12.4
%
(
273
of
2194
)
,
and
the
``
corrected
''
primary
rate
was
9.6
%
(
190
of
1975
)

Furthermore
,
when
all
deliveries
were
analyzed
,
regardless
of
risk
status
but
limited
to
gestational
age
>
or
=
36
weeks
,
the
rates
did
not
change
(
12.6
%
,
280
of
2214
;
primary
9.2
%
,
183
of
1994
)

Arrest
of
dilation
was
the
most
common
indication
in
both
``
corrected
''
subgroups
(
23.4
and
24.6
%
,
respectively
)

Cesarean
rates
at
tertiary
care
hospitals
should
be
compared
with
rates
at
community
hospitals
only
after
correcting
for
dissimilar
patient
groups
or
gestational
age

In
the
third
trimester
,
the
amniotic
fluid
index
(
AFI
)
may
be
affected
by
maternal
fluid
status

As
the
ambient
temperature
increases
,
there
is
an
increase
in
insensible
fluid
loss
and
the
potential
for
dehydration

We
hypothesize
that
as
temperature
increases
there
would
be
a
concomitant
decrease
in
AFI

From
June
11
to
August
16
,
1993
,
during
a
period
of
unusual
high
heat
,
42
women
with
singleton
pregnancies
between
27
and
40
weeks
'
gestation
undergoing
serial
antenatal
testing
had
AFI
determinations
recorded
at
least
weekly

The
daily
high
ambient
temperature
in
our
urban
area
was
subsequently
obtained

A
2-
,
3-
,
and
4-day
mean
temperature
prior
to
the
test
date
was
compared
to
AFI
using
a
Spearman-rank
Correlation

The
daily
high
temperature
ranged
from
71
to
104
degrees
F
and
AFI
values
ranged
from
1.7
to
24.7
cm
during
the
study
period

There
was
a
significant
correlation
between
the
2-
,
3-
,
and
4-day
mean
temperature
and
AFI
,
with
the
4-day
mean
being
the
most
significant
(
r
=
0.31
,
p
&
#
60
;
0.001
)

Fluctuations
in
ambient
temperature
are
inversely
correlated
to
changes
in
AFI

This
relationship
should
be
taken
into
account
when
interpreting
the
AFI
as
a
measure
of
fetal
well-being

This
study
tested
the
hypothesis
that
to
reduce
the
rate
of
macrosomic
infants
in
gestational
diabetes
cases
,
good
glycemic
control
should
be
initiated
before
34
completed
gestational
weeks

The
study
population
included
84
women
with
gestational
diabetes
,
ascertained
by
universal
screening
of
all
women
attending
the
antenatal
clinic
of
the
Hadassah
Medical
Center
,
over
a
2-year
period

The
60
women
(
71
%
)
,
who
initiated
treatment
before
34
completed
weeks
,
composed
the
``
early
''
group

The
24
women
(
29
%
)
,
who
initiated
treatment
after
the
34th
week
,
composed
the
``
late
''
group

All
patients
were
managed
by
an
intensified
protocol
,
including
stringent
glycemic
control

In
the
``
early
''
and
``
late
''
groups
,
mean
gestational
age
at
the
beginning
of
treatment
was
30.0
+/-
3.8
and
36.2
+/-
1.2
weeks
,
and
duration
of
treatment
was
9.6
+/-
4.1
and
3.7
+/-
1.8
weeks
,
respectively

Maternal
characteristics
were
similar
in
the
two
groups

The
rate
of
macrosomic
and
large-for-gestational-age
infants
were
5
and
11
%
,
respectively
,
in
the
early
group
as
compared
to
25
and
29
%
in
the
``
late
''
group
(
p
&
#
60
;
0.05
)

No
significant
differences
were
found
between
the
two
groups
in
the
mode
of
delivery
or
Apgar
scores

We
conclude
that
to
reduce
the
rate
of
macrosomic
infants
in
gestational
diabetes
cases
,
good
glycemic
control
should
be
initiated
before
34
completed
gestational
weeks

Our
aim
was
to
investigate
the
contribution
of
certain
antenatally
detectable
markers
leading
to
the
diagnosis
of
trisomic
fetuses
we
observed
over
a
period
of
6
years

In
our
study
,
we
specifically
analyzed
the
role
played
by
advanced
maternal
age
and
sonographically
discovered
abnormalities
in
the
detection
of
autosomal
trisomies

All
together
,
27
fetuses
had
this
disorder
,
representing
28.7
%
(
27
of
94
)
of
all
cytogenetic
aberrations
detected
at
our
center
over
the
same
period

Down
syndrome
(
12
cases
)
and
Edward
syndrome
(
11
cases
)
were
the
most
common
trisomies
,
while
4
cases
of
Patau
syndrome
were
also
diagnosed

The
most
common
indication
leading
to
diagnosis
was
abnormal
ultrasound
finding
(
48.2
%
)
,
followed
by
advanced
maternal
age
(
44.4
%
)

However
,
63
%
of
the
trisomic
fetuses
belonged
to
mothers
aged
35
years
and
above

Down
syndrome
fetuses
(
41.7
%
)
had
prenatally
detected
sonographic
anomalies
,
63.6
%
for
Edward
syndrome
,
and
all
fetuses
with
Patau
syndrome
(
4
of
4
)
showed
abnormal
sonographic
signs

Trisomy
21
presented
with
the
following
features
:
hydramnios
,
complex
malformations
,
pyelectasis
,
and
duodenal
atresia

Trisomy
18
fetuses
showed
hydramnios
,
intrauterine
growth
retardation
,
microcephaly
,
spina
bifida
,
and
nonimmune
hydrops
fetalis

Signs
observed
in
fetuses
with
trisomy
13
were
:
hydrocephalus
,
intrauterine
growth
retardation
,
oligoanhydramnios
,
complex
malformations
,
severe
fetal
bradycardia
and
hydronephrosis

The
objective
of
this
study
was
to
determine
if
the
rate
of
preeclampsia
is
increased
in
triplet
as
compared
to
twin
gestations

Fifty-three
triplet
pregnancies
between
1986
and
1993
at
The
New
York
Hospital-Cornell
Medical
Center
were
reviewed

These
were
matched
for
maternal
age
,
parity
,
and
race
to
twin
gestations
(
N
=
53
)
from
the
same
population

Severe
preeclampsia
was
defined
by
standard
criteria

Student
's
t-test
,
Fisher
exact
test
,
and
Chi-square
were
used
for
statistical
analysis

The
rate
of
severe
preeclampsia
was
increased
significantly
in
the
triplet
group
12
of
53
(
22.6
%
)
as
compared
with
the
twin
group
3
of
53
(
5.7
%
)
(
OR
=
4.9
,
95
%
CI
1.2-23.5
,
p
=
0.02
)

The
rate
of
overall
preeclampsia
was
not
significantly
different
in
the
triplet
18
of
53
(
33.96
%
)
or
twin
12
of
53
(
22.6
%
)
groups

In
this
retrospective
,
case-controlled
study
,
the
rate
of
severe
pre-eclampsia
was
significantly
increased
in
triplet
gestations
as
compared
to
twins
although
the
overall
rate
of
preeclampsia
was
not

This
information
may
be
useful
in
counseling
patients
with
high
order
multifetal
gestations

We
conducted
a
survey
and
audit
of
thermal
equipment
use
in
very
low-birth-weight
infants
in
five
Ohio
neonatal
intensive
care
units
(
NICUs
)
to
document
regional
practice

The
survey
indicated
a
variety
of
thermal
care
styles

Two
NICUs
preferred
to
admit
infants
to
incubators
,
the
other
three
favoring
radiant
warmers

These
three
NICUs
moved
infants
from
radiant
warmers
into
incubators
at
significantly
different
mean
ages

The
audit
demonstrated
inconsistent
use
of
plastic
covers
,
warming
mattresses
,
and
added
humidity
under
radiant
warmers
,
and
discrepancies
between
survey
responses
and
actual
use
within
NICUs

Inter-NICU
variability
of
thermal
equipment
use
may
complicate
fluid
management

This
report
describes
a
full-term
newborn
with
massive
fetomaternal
hemorrhage

Fetal
movements
were
decreased
48
hr
prior
to
delivery

On
the
day
of
delivery
,
they
were
absent

The
nonstress
test
was
abnormal
with
low
biophysical
profile
and
decreased
beat-to-beat
variability

The
infant
presented
with
extreme
pallor
,
hypotonia
,
hepatosplenomegaly
,
and
ascites

The
initial
hemoglobin
was
2.2
g/dL
,
the
Kleihauer-Betke
stain
was
27.6
%
(
highest
level
ever
reported
)

Right
temporal
and
cerebellar
hemorrhages
were
present

Sequelae
include
severe
developmental
delay
and
asymmetric
double
hemiplegia

Omphalocele-Exstrophy-Imperforate
anus-Spinal
defects
(
OEIS
complex
)
,
a
combination
of
omphalocele
,
exstrophy
of
the
bladder
,
an
imperforate
anus
and
spinal
defects
,
arises
from
a
single
localized
defect
in
the
early
development
of
the
mesoderm
that
will
later
contribute
to
infraumbilical
mesenchyme
,
cloacal
septum
,
and
caudal
vertebrae

In
this
report
,
we
document
the
perinatal
features
of
two
cases
of
OEIS
complex
associated
with
meningomyeloceles
and
severe
lower
limb
defects
,
and
discuss
the
prenatal
diagnosis
,
inheritance
,
and
differential
diagnosis
of
this
association
of
malformations

Although
long-term
survival
can
be
achieved
by
successful
corrective
surgery
,
the
associated
structural
defects
such
as
large
meningomyelocele
and
severe
limb
aplasia
or
hypoplasia
,
as
seen
in
our
patient
,
can
influence
the
patient
's
quality
of
life
.

We
would
like
to
emphasize
that
an
accurate
prenatal
diagnosis
of
OEIS
complex
and
associated
malformations
is
important
for
the
detailed
counseling
of
the
family
as
well
as
appropriate
perinatal
management
by
the
obstetricians
,
pediatric
surgeons
,
urologists
,
neurosurgeons
,
and
neonatologists

Nonimmune
hydrops
fetails
diagnosed
at
21
weeks
'
gestation
with
profound
ascites
,
hydrothorax
,
and
pericardial
effusion
receded
gradually
with
regression
of
a
subchorial
placental
lucencies
immediately
below
the
umbilical
cord
insertion

Careful
inspection
of
the
delivered
placenta
revealed
that
there
was
a
yellowish
lesion
of
fibrin
deposits
below
the
cord
insertion
site
,
which
resulted
from
the
absorption
of
hematoma

A
subchorial
placental
hematoma
,
which
detected
as
a
subchorial
placental
lucencies
by
ultrasonography
,
can
be
a
cause
of
reversible
nonimmune
hydrops
fetalis

The
mitochondrial
diseases
are
uncommon
multisystem
disorders
characterized
by
the
presence
of
functionally
and/or
structurally
abnormal
mitochondria

As
there
have
been
few
reports
of
the
obstetrical
care
of
affected
patients
,
we
wish
to
document
two
pregnancies
in
a
woman
with
a
Chronic
Progressive
External
Ophthalmoplegia
(
Kearns-Sayre-like
syndrome
)

Both
pregnancies
were
complicated
by
preterm
labor
and
hypertension

CONTEXT
:
Four
genetic
loci
have
been
identified
as
contributing
to
Alzheimer
disease
(
AD
)
,
including
the
amyloid
precursor
protein
gene
,
the
presenilin
1
gene
,
the
presenilin
2
gene
,
and
the
apolipoprotein
E
gene
,
but
do
not
account
for
all
the
genetic
risk
for
AD

OBJECTIVE
:
To
identify
additional
genetic
risk
factors
for
late-onset
AD

DESIGN
:
A
complete
genomic
screen
was
performed
(
N=280
markers
)

Critical
values
for
chromosomal
regional
follow-up
were
a
P
value
of
.05
or
less
for
affected
relative
pair
analysis
or
sibpair
analysis
,
a
parametric
lod
score
of
1.0
or
greater
,
or
both

Regional
follow-up
included
analysis
of
additional
markers
and
a
second

set

SETTING
:
Clinic

From
a
series
of

=60
years
)
AD
ascertained

)
and
for
which

has
been
obtained
,
a
subset
of
16
families
(
135
total
family
members
,
52
of
whom
were
patients
with
AD
)
was
used
for
the

subset
of
38
families
(
216
total

members
,
89
of
whom
were
patients
with
AD
)
was
used
for
the
follow-up
analysis

MAIN
OUTCOME
MEASURES
:
Linkage
analysis
results
generated
using
both
genetic
model-dependent
(
lod
score
)
and
model-independent
methods

RESULTS
:
Fifteen
chromosomal
regions
warranted
initial
follow-up

Follow-up
analyses
revealed
4
regions
of
continued
interest
on
chromosomes
4
,
6
,
12
,
and
20
,
with
the
strongest

,
D12S1057
,
D12S1042

,
respectively

Sibpair

resulted
in
maximum

)
of
1.5
,
2.6
,
3.2
,
and
2.3
for
these

,
with
a
peak

of
3.5

A

stratification
by
APOE
genotype
identified
27
families
that
had
at
least
1
member
with
AD
whose
genotype
did
not
contain
an
APOE*4
allele

Analysis
of
these
27
families
resulted
in
MLSs
of
1.0
,
2.4
,
3.7
,
and
3.3
and
a
peak

MLS
of
3.9

CONCLUSIONS
:
A
complete
genomic
screen
in
families
affected
with
late-onset
AD
identified
4
regions
of
interest
after
follow-up

Chromosome
12
gave
the
strongest
and
most
consistent
results
with
a
peak
multipoint
MLS
of
3.5
,
suggesting
that
this
region
contains
a
new
susceptibility
gene
for
AD

Additional
analyses
are
necessary
to
identify
the
chromosome
12
susceptibility
gene
for
AD
and
to
follow
up
the
regions
of
interest
on
chromosomes
4
,
6
,
and
20

CONTEXT
:
A
mutation
in
the
BRCA1
gene
may
confer
substantial
risk
for
breast
and/or
ovarian
cancer

However
,
knowledge
regarding
all
possible
mutations
and
the
relationship
between
risk
factors
and
mutations
is
incomplete

OBJECTIVES
:
To
identify
BRCA1
mutations
and
to
determine
factors
that
best
predict
presence
of
a
deleterious
BRCA1
mutation
in
patients
with
breast
and/or
ovarian
cancer

DESIGN
:
A
complete
sequence
analysis
of
the
BRCA1
coding
sequence
and
flanking
intronic
regions
was
performed
in
798
women
in
a
collaborative
effort
involving
institutions
from
the
United
States
,
Italy
,
Germany
,
Finland
,
and
Switzerland

PARTICIPANTS
:
Institutions
selected
798
persons
representing
families
(
1
person
for
each
family
)
thought
to
be
at
elevated
a
priori
risk
of
BRCA1
mutation
due
to
potential
risk
factors
,
such
as
multiple
cases
of
breast
cancer
,
early
age
of
breast
cancer
diagnosis
,
and
cases
of
ovarian
cancer

No
participant
was
from
a
family
in
which
genetic
markers
showed
linkage
to
the
BRCA1
locus

MAJOR
OUTCOME
MEASURES
:
Sequence
variants
detected
in
this
sample
are
presented
along
with
analyses
designed
to
determine
predictive
characteristics
of
those
testing
positive
for
BRCA1
mutations

RESULTS
:
In
102
women
(
12.8
%
)
,
clearly
deleterious
mutations
were
detected

Fifty
new
genetic
alterations
were
found
including
24
deleterious
mutations
,
24
variants
of
unknown
significance
,
and
2
rare
polymorphisms

In
a
subset
of
71
Ashkenazi
Jewish
women
,
only
2
distinct
deleterious
mutations
were
found
:
185delAG
in
17
cases
and
5382insC
in
7
cases

A
bias
in
prior
reports
for
mutations
in
exon
11
was
revealed

Characteristics
of
a
patient
's
specific
diagnosis
(
unilateral
or
bilateral
breast
cancer
,
with
or
without
ovarian
cancer
)
,
early
age
at
diagnosis
,
Ashkenazi
Jewish
ethnicity
,
and
family
history
of
cancer
were
positively
associated
with
the
probability
of
her
carrying
a
deleterious
BRCA1
mutation

CONCLUSIONS
:
Using
logistic

,
we
provide
a
method
for
evaluating
the
probability
of
a
woman
's
carrying
a
deleterious
BRCA1
mutation
for
a
wide
range
of
cases
,
which
can
be
an
important
tool
for
clinicians
as
they
incorporate
genetic
susceptibility
testing
into
their
medical
practice

CONTEXT
:
Approximately
9
%
of
prostate
cancer
cases
have
been
estimated
to
result
from
inheritance
of
mutated
prostate
cancer
susceptibility
genes

Few
data
exist
as
to
whether
there
are
clinical
differences
between
prostate
cancers
that
are
inherited
and
those
that
occur
in
the
general
population

OBJECTIVE
:
To
investigate
phenotypic
characteristics
of
families
potentially
linked
to
the
hereditary
prostate
cancer
1
(
HPC1
)
locus
on
chromosome
1q24-25

DESIGN
:
Retrospective
case
study
in
which
clinical
data
were
extracted
from
medical
and
pathological
records

FAMILIES
:
A
total
of
74
North
American
families
with
hereditary
prostate
cancer

Prostate
cancer
cases
from
the
National
Cancer
Data
Base
were
used
as
a
reference
population
for
comparison

MAIN
OUTCOME
MEASURES
:
The
families
were
divided
into
2
groups
:
either
potentially
linked
(
33
families
with
133
men
with
prostate
cancer
)
,
and
thus
likely
to
be
carrying
an
altered
HPC1
gene
,
or
potentially
unlinked
(
41
families
with
172
men
with
prostate
cancer
)
,
on
the
basis
of
haplotype
analysis
in
the
region
of
HPC1

The
age
at
diagnosis
of
prostate
cancer
,
serum
prostate-specific
antigen
levels
,
digital
rectal
examination
status
,
stage
,
grade
,
primary
treatment
of
prostate
cancers
,
and
occurrence
of
other
cancers
were
compared
between
the
groups

RESULTS
:
The
mean
age
at
diagnosis
of
prostate
cancer
for
men
in
potentially
linked
families
was
significantly
lower
than
for
men
in
potentially
unlinked
families
(
63.7
vs
65.9
years
,
respectively
,
P=.01
;
mean
age
at
diagnosis
in
the
reference
population
was
71.6
years
)

Higher-grade
cancers
(
grade
3
)
were
more
common
in
potentially
linked
families
,
and
advanced-stage
disease
was
found
in
41
%
of
the
case
patients
in
potentially
linked
families
compared
with
31
%
in
both
the
potentially
unlinked
families
and
the
reference
groups
(
P=.03
for
the
latter
comparison
)

In
the
other
clinical
parameters
,
we
found
no
significant
differences
between
the
groups

A
modest
excess
of
breast
cancer
and
colon
cancer
was
found
in
potentially
linked
families
in
comparison
with
potentially
unlinked
families
,
but
this
difference
was
not
statistically
significant

CONCLUSIONS
:
Families
that
provide
evidence
for
segregation
of
an
altered
HPC1
gene
are
characterized
by
multiple
cases
of
prostate
cancer
that
,
in
most
respects
,
are
indistinguishable
from
nonhereditary
cases

However
,
3
characteristics
were
observed
:
younger
age
at
diagnosis
,
higher-grade
tumors
,
and
more
advanced-stage
disease

Our
study
shows
that
a
significant
fraction
of
hereditary
prostate
cancers
are
diagnosed
in
advanced
stages
,
emphasizing
the
clinical
importance
of
early
detection
in
men
potentially
carrying
prostate
cancer
susceptibility
genes

These
findings
support
the
current
recommendations
to
screen
men
with
a
positive
family
history
of
prostate
cancer
beginning
at
age
40
years

CONTEXT
:
Susceptibility
to
multiple
sclerosis
(
MS
)
involves
a
genetically
complex
autoimmune
component

However
,
except
for
genes
in
the
HLA
system
,
specific
susceptibility
loci
are
unknown
or
unconfirmed

OBJECTIVE
:
To
investigate
several
loci
spanning
3
candidate
regions
for
a
role
in
multiple
sclerosis
(
MS
)
susceptibility
in
2
ethnic
groups
using
both
single-locus
and
haplotype
analyses

The
3
regions
include
HLA
on
chromosome
6p21.3
,
APOE
on
chromosome
19ql
3.2
,
and
MBP
(
myelin
basic
protein
)
on
chromosome
18q23

DESIGN
:
Case-control
association
testing

SUBJECTS
:
A
total
of
120
Caucasian
patients
with
MS
and
107
unrelated
control
individuals
from
California
,
and
32
patients
and
32
unrelated
control
individuals
from
Beijing
,
China

All
patients
with
MS
were
diagnosed
as
having
clinically
definite
disease
according
to
published
criteria

MAIN
OUTCOME
MEASURES
:
Chi2
Testing
of
loci
and
individual
alleles
and
haplotypes

Haplotype
frequencies
were
estimated
with
standard
maximum
likelihood
methods

RESULTS
:
The
HLA
effect
is
due
to
the
class
II
DR2
haplotype
,
DRB1*1501-DQA1*0102-DRB1*0602
;
contributions
to
MS
susceptibility
from
additional
DRB1-DQB1
alleles
or
other
HLA
region
loci
were
not
observed

Variation
within
the
MBP
locus
on
chromosome
18q23
showed
no
effect
in
MS

The
distribution
of
haplotypes
from
5
loci
within
the
chromosome
19q13.2
region
,
including
D19S178
,
D19S574
,
APOE
,
APOC2
,
and
D19S219
,
differed
between
patient
and
control
samples

D19S574
showed
a
significant
effect
(
P=.015
)
in
Caucasian
patients
with
MS
due
to
the
increased
frequency
of
a
single
allele
(
P=.002
)

The
APOE
variation
,
prominent
in
other
neurological
diseases
,
showed
no
influence
on
MS
susceptibility
,
despite
its
location
within
the
chromosome
19q13.2
region

Interaction
effects
between
DR2
and
chromosome
19q13.2
or
MBP
in
MS
susceptibility
were
not
apparent

CONCLUSIONS
:
The
significant
chromosome
19q13.2
single-locus
and
multilocus
haplotype
associations
with
MS
in
Caucasian
and
Chinese
patient
samples
indicate
an
effect
from
a
nearby
disease
susceptibility
locus

These
initial
observations
are
an
encouraging
step
toward
the
description
of
non-HLA
genetic
susceptibility
to
MS

long-term
risk
of
new
primary
cancers
in
survivors
of
childhood

DESIGN
:
Cohort

of
20
years
,
and
nested

SETTING/PARTICIPANTS
:
A

who
survived
at

1
year
after
diagnosis
,
identified
from
hospital
records
in
Massachusetts
and
New
York
during
1914
to
1984

RESULTS
:
Incidence
of
subsequent
cancers
was
statistically
significantly
elevated
only
in
the
961
patients
with
hereditary

,
in
whom
190

)

Cumulative

was
51.0

All
114
sarcomas
of

CONCLUSIONS
:
Genetic
predisposition
has
a
substantial
impact
on
risk
of
subsequent
cancers
in
retinoblastoma
patients
,
which
is
further
increased
by
radiation
treatment

A
radiation
dose-response
relationship
is
demonstrated
for
all
sarcomas
and
,
for
the
first
time
in
humans
,
for
soft
tissue
sarcomas

Retinoblastoma
patients
should
be
examined
for
new
cancers
and
followed
into
later
life
to
determine
whether
their
extraordinary
cancer
risk
extends
to
common
cancers
of
adulthood

The
objective
of
this
study
was
to
determine
the
rate
of
recent
cocaine
use
among
a
metropolitan
population
of
predominantly
Hispanic
and
African-American
women
with
preterm
premature
rupture
of
the
membranes
(
PROM
)
and
to
ascertain
the
impact
of
cocaine
on
the
latency
period
between
rupture
of
membranes
and
delivery

Urine
toxicology
screens
were
prospectively
obtained
on
147
women
with
preterm
PROM

The
urine
screen
did
not
influence
management
decisions

All
women
were
expectantly
managed
without
tocolytics
until
37
weeks
'
gestation
unless
they
developed
clinical
chorioamnionitis
,
or
nonreassuring
fetal
heart
rate
tracing
or
biophysical
profile

Demographic
information
,
hours
from
rupture
of
membranes
to
delivery
,
gestational
age
,
and
birth
weight
at
delivery
were
compared
using
Fisher
's
exact
,
Mann-Whitney
U
,
and
randomization
tests
where
appropriate

The
rate
of
positive
urine
drug
screens
for
cocaine
was
8.2
%

Women
in
the
cocaine
positive
group
were
of
higher
parity
(
3
,
(
0-7
)
vs.
1
,
(
0-6
)
,
p
=
0.001
)
and
tended
to
be
older
(
27
,
(
23-42
)
vs.
25
,
(
14-40
)
)

There
was
a
higher
rate
of
recent
cocaine
use
among
African-American
women
(
20.4
%
)
as
compared
to
non-African-Americans
(
1.2
%
,
p
=
0.0001
)

Cocaine-positive
women
presented
at
an
earlier
gestational
age
(
32
weeks
'
,
(
24-34
)
vs.
33
weeks
'
,
(
23-36
)
,
p
=
0.02
)
and
had
a
significantly
longer
membrane
rupture
to
delivery
interval
than
women
with
a
negative
urine
drug
screen
(
174
hr
,
(
6-475
)
vs.
33
hours
(
1-833
)
,
p
=
0.01
)

There
was
no
significant
difference
in
the
reason
for
delivery
between
the
two
groups
of
patients

Recent
cocaine
use
among
women
with
preterm
PROM
is
common
in
only
some
segments
of
an
urban
population

Women
with
recent
cocaine
use
present
with
ruptured
membranes
at
an
earlier
gestational
age
and
may
actually
have
a
longer
latency
period
than
women
who
do
not
use
cocaine

The
objective
of
this
article
is
to
explore
attitudes
of
an
inner-city
,
pregnant
cohort
about
general
and
HIV-related
prenatal
care

Responses
to
an
interview
at
initial
prenatal
care
enrollment
were
compared
using
Chi-square
and
Fisher
's
exact
tests

Of
75
women
,
drug
users
(
51
%
)
were
more
likely
to
say
that
they
would
defer
initiating
prenatal
care
(
P
=
0.03
)
and
to
minimize
the
risk
of
drug
or
alcohol
use
to
the
fetus
(
P
=
0.04
)

Most
(
85
%
)
viewed
pregnancy
as
inappropriate
for
HIV
infected
women
and
primarily
drug
users
(
P
=
0.06
)
would
abort
if
HIV
infected

Over
half
thought
HIV
transmission
occurred
most
times
or
always

Only
20
%
had
heard
of
a
drug
to
reduce
this
risk
,
but
95
%
would
take
such
a
therapy

These
inner-city
,
pregnant
women
disapproved
of
pregnancy
if
HIV
infected
and
thought
the
risk
of
transmission
was
high

They
knew
little
of
how
to
reduce
this
risk
but
nearly
all
would
accept
a
drug
to
prevent
transmission

The
association
of
parvovirus
B19
infection
and
hydrops
fetalis
is
well
known

However
,
the
association
of
parvovirus
and
fetal
pleural
or
pericardial
effusions
has
not
been
reported

We
present
five
cases
of
isolated
pleural
or
pericardial
effusion
with
documented
maternal
parvovirus
infection
in
four
of
these
pregnancies

In
the
absence
of
structural
or
karyotypic
abnormalities
,
spontaneous
resolution
of
the
effusion
portends
for
a
successful
pregnancy
outcome

BACKGROUND
:
Cochlear
implantation
is
nowadays
a
reliable
and
well-accepted
method
of
auditory
rehabilitation
in
selected
adults
and
children

METHODS
:
We
present
rehabilitation
data
on
21
adult
patients
provided
with
the
Nucleus
CI22
M
cochlear
implant
using
the
SPEAK
strategy

RESULTS
:
Results
of
first
tune-up
show
an
open
set
speech
understanding
in
approximately
50
%
of
patients

Long-term
results
also
reveal
further
improvement
in
patients
who
had
no
open
set
speech
understanding

Our
data
seem
to
indicate
similar
results
in
comparison
to
other
groups
using
the
CIS
strategy

CONCLUSIONS
:
In
adults
,
open
set
speech
understanding
can
be
achieved
even
at
the
first
tune-up

Results
of
early
rehabilitation
seem
to
be
influenced
by
duration
and
etiology
of
deafness
,
experience
with
hearing
aids
,
and
other
factors

Adverse
drug
effects
are
manifold
and
heterogenous

Many
situations
may
hamper
the
signalling
(
i.e
.
the
detection
of
early
warning
signs
)
of
adverse
effects
and
new
signals
often
differ
from
previous
experiences

Signals
have
qualitative
and
quantitative
aspects

Different
categories
of
adverse
effects
need
different
methods
for
detection

Current
pharmacovigilance
is
predominantly
based
on
spontaneous
reporting
and
is
mainly
helpful
in
detecting
type
B
effects
(
those
effects
that
are
often
allergic
or
idiosyncratic
reactions
,
characteristically
occurring
in
only
a
minority
of
patients
and
usually
unrelated
to
dosage
and
that
are
serious
,
unexpected
and
unpredictable
)
and
unusual
type
A
effects
(
those
effects
that
are
related
to
the
pharmacological
effects
of
the
drug
and
are
dosage-related
)

Examples
of
other
sources
of
signals
are
prescription
event
monitoring
,
large
automated
data
resources
on
morbidity
and
drug
use
(
including
record
linkage
)
,
case-control
surveillance
and
follow-up
studies

Type
C
effects
(
those
effects
related
to
an
increased
frequency
of
'spontaneous
'
disease
)
are
difficult
to
study
,
however
,
and
continue
to
pose
a
pharmacoepidemiological
challenge

Seven
basic
considerations
can
be
identified
that
determine
the
evidence
contained
in
a
signal
:
quantitative
strength
of
the
association
,
consistency
of
the
data
,
exposure
response
relationship
,
biological
plausibility
,
experimental
findings
,
possible
analogies
and
the
nature
and
quality
of
the
data

A
proposal
is
made
for
a
standard
signal
management
procedure
at
pharmacovigilance
centres
,
including
the
following
steps
:
signal
delineation
,
literature
search
,
preliminary
inventory
of
data
,
collection
of
additional
information
,
consultation
with
the
World
Health
Organization
Centre
for
International
Drug
Monitoring
and
the
relevant
drug
companies
,
aggregated
data
assessment
and
a
report
in
writing

A
better
understanding
of
the
conditions
and
mechanisms
involved
in
the
detection
of
adverse
drug
effects
may
further
improve
strategies
for
pharmacovigilance

OBJECTIVE
:
To
study
the
safety
and
efficacy
of
methylphenidate
in
children
with
the
dual
diagnosis
of
epilepsy
and
attention
deficit
hyperactivity
disorder
(
ADHD
)

STUDY
DESIGN
:
Thirty
children
,
aged
6.4
to
16.4
years
,
with
epilepsy
and
ADHD
were
studied
during
a
4-month
period

During
the
initial
2
months
of
the
study
,
the
children
were
treated
with
antiepileptic
drugs
(
AEDs
)
only
,
and
for
the
remaining
2
months
,
methylphenidate
was
added
at
a
morning
dose
of
0.3
mg/kg

They
underwent
neurologic
assessment
,
brain
computed
tomography
,
IQ
testing
,
and
assessment
with
the
Childhood
Behavior
Checklist
at
baseline
before
methylphenidate
therapy

Electroencephalography
,
AED
determinations
,
and
the
continuous-performance
task
(
CPT
)
test
were
done
at
baseline
and
after
2
months
of
methylphenidate
therapy

A
double-blind
,
crossover
design
was
used
to
compare
the
effects
of
methylphenidate
versus
placebo
on
an
electroencephalogram
,
AED
levels
,
and
the
CPT

On
the
2
days
of
testing
,
the
child
received
AEDs
and
a
capsule
containing
either
placebo
or
methylphenidate

RESULTS
:
None
of
the
25
children
of
this
sample
who
were
seizure
free
had
attacks
while
taking
methylphenidate

Of
the
5
children
with
seizures
,
3
had
an
increase
in
attacks
,
whereas
the
other
2
showed
no
change
or
a
reduction

There
were
no
significant
changes
in
AED
levels
or
electroencephalographic
findings

Methylphenidate
benefited
70
%
of
children
according
to
parental
report
;
methylphenidate
also
enhanced
performance
on
the
CPT

Side
effects
of
methylphenidate
were
mild
and
transient

CONCLUSION
:
Methylphenidate
is
effective
in
treating
children
with
epilepsy
and
ADHD
and
safe
in
children
who
are
seizure
free

Caution
is
warranted
for

The
temporal
properties
of
semantic
and
phonological
processes
in
speech
production
were
investigated
in
a
new
experimental
paradigm
using
movement-related
brain
potentials

The
main
experimental
task
was
picture
naming

In
addition
,
a
2-choice
reaction
go/no-go
procedure
was
included
,
involving
a
semantic
and
a
phonological
categorization
of
the
picture
name

Lateralized
readiness
potentials
(
LRPs
)
were
derived
to
test
whether
semantic
and
phonological
information
activated
motor
processes
at
separate
moments
in
time

An
LRP
was
only
observed
on
no-go
trials
when
the
semantic
(
not
the
phonological
)
decision
determined
the
response
hand

Varying
the
position
of
the
critical
phoneme
in
the
picture
name
did
not
affect
the
onset
of
the
LRP
but
rather
influenced
when
the
LRP
began
to
differ
on
go
and
no-go
trials
and
allowed
the
duration
of
phonological
encoding
of
a
word
to
be
estimated

These
results
provide
electrophysiological
evidence
for
early
semantic
activation
and
later
phonological
encoding

The
effects
of
alanine
and
glycine
substitution
for
tryptophan
upon
the
species
heterogeneity
of
gramicidin
A
analogs
incorporated
into
SDS
micelles
have
been
investigated

The
sequential
replacement
of
the
four
tryptophan
residues
in
gramicidin
A
at
positions
15
,
13
,
11
,
and
9
with
glycine
showed
that
there
was
no
detectable
effect
at
position
15
but
increasing
heterogeneity
of
species
in
the
micelles
proceeding
toward
the
interior
of
the
micelle
at
position
9

The
replacement
of
tryptophan
at
positions
15
and
9
with
alanine
was
found
to
produce
more
species
heterogeneity
than
found
with
glycine
substitution
at
the
same
positions

An
increase
in
the
SDS
concentration
reduces
the
number
of
different
species
present
in
micelles

With
the
Gly-11
,
Gly-13
,
and
Gly-15
analogs
,
the
increase
in
SDS
concentration
results
in
the
formation
of
a
single
species
;
however
,
for
the
Gly-9
,
Ala-9
,
and
Ala-15
analogs
,
heterogeneity
remains

Molecular
dynamics
in
torsion-angle
space
was
applied
to
nuclear
magnetic
resonance
structure
calculation
using
nuclear
Overhauser
effect-derived
distances
and
J-coupling-constant-derived
dihedral
angle
restraints

Compared
to
two
other
commonly
used
algorithms
,
molecular
dynamics
in
Cartesian
space
and
metric-matrix
geometry
combined
with
Cartesian
molecular
dynamics
,
the
method
shows
increased
computational
efficiency
and
success
rate
for
large
proteins
,
and
it
shows
a
dramatically
increased
radius
of
convergence
for
DNA

The
torsion-angle
molecular
dynamics
algorithm
starts
from
an
extended
strand
conformation
and
proceeds
in
four
stages
:
high-temperature
torsion-angle
molecular
dynamics
,
slow-cooling
torsion-angle
molecular
dynamics
,
Cartesian
molecular
dynamics
,
and
minimization

Tests
were
carried
out
using
experimental
NMR
data
for
protein
G
,
interleukin-8
,
villin
14T
,
and
a
12
base-pair
duplex
of
DNA
,
and
simulated
NMR
data
for
bovine
pancreatic
trypsin
inhibitor

For
villin
14T
,
a
monomer
consisting
of
126
residues
,
structure
determination
by
torsion-angle
molecular
dynamics
has
a
success
rate
of
85
%
,
a
more
than
twofold
improvement
over
other
methods

In
the
case
of
the
12
base-pair
DNA
duplex
,
torsion-angle
molecular
dynamics
had
a
success
rate
of
52
%
while
Cartesian
molecular
dynamics
and
metric-matrix
distance
geometry
always
failed

The
wavelet-transform
method
is
used
to
quantify
the
magnetic
resonance
spectroscopy
(
MRS
)
parameters
:
chemical
shift
,
apparent
relaxation
time
T2
,
resonance
amplitude
,
and
phase

Wavelet
transformation
is
a
time-frequency
representation
which
separates
each
component
from
the
FID
,
then
successively
quantifies
it
and
subtracts
it
from
the
raw
signal

Two
iterative
procedures
have
been
developed

They
have
been
combined
with
a
nonlinear
regression
analysis
method
and
tested
on
both
simulated
and
real
sets
of
biomedical
MRS
data
selected
with
respect
to
the
main
problems
usually
encountered
in
quantifying
biomedical
MRS
,
specifically
``
chemical
noise
,
''
resulting
from
overlapping
resonances
,
and
baseline
distortion

The
results
indicate
that
the
wavelet-transform
method
can
provide
efficient
and
accurate
quantification
of
MRS
data

BACKGROUND
:
Antiplatelet
therapy
with
aspirin
and
systematic
anticoagulation
with
warfarin
reduce
cardiovascular
morbidity
and
mortality
after
myocardial
infarction
when
given
alone

In
the
Coumadin
Aspirin
Reinfarction
Study
(
CARS
)
,
we
aimed
to
find
out
whether
a
combination
of
low-dose
warfarin
and
low-dose
aspirin
would
give
superior
results
to
standard
aspirin
monotherapy
without
excessive
bleeding
risk

METHODS
:
We
used
a
randomised
double-blind
study
design

At
293
sites
,
we
randomly
assigned
8803
patients
who
had
had
myocardial
infarction
,
treatment
with
160
mg
aspirin
,
3
mg
warfarin
with
80
mg
aspirin
,
or
1
mg
warfarin
with
80
mg
aspirin

Patients
took
a
single
tablet
daily
,
and
attended
for
prothrombin
time
(
PT
)
measurements
at
weeks
1
,
2
,
3
,
4
,
6
,
and
12
,
and
then
every
3
months

Patients
were
followed
up
for
a
maximum
of
33
months
(
median
14
months
)

FINDINGS
:
The
primary
event
was
first
occurrence
of
reinfarction
,
non-fatal
ischaemic
stroke
,
or
cardiovascular
death

1-year
life-table
estimates
for
the
primary
event
were
8.6
%
(
95
%
CI
7.6-9.6
)
for
160
mg
aspirin
,
8.4
%
(
7.4-9.4
)
for
3
mg
warfarin
with
80
mg
aspirin
,
and
8.8
%
(
7.6-10
)
for
1
mg
warfarin
with
80
mg
aspirin

Primary
comparisons
were
done
with
all
follow-up
data

The
relative
risk
of
the
primary
event
for
the
160
mg
aspirin
group
compared
with
the
3
mg
warfarin
with
80
mg
aspirin
group
was
0.95
(
0.81-1.12
,
p
=
0.57
)

For
spontaneous
major
haemorrhage
(
not
procedure
related
)
,
1-year
life-table
estimates
were
0.74
%
(
0.43-1.1
)
in
the
160
mg
aspirin
group
and
1.4
%
(
0.94-1.8
)
in
the
3
mg
warfarin
with
80
mg
aspirin
group
(
p
=
0.014
log
rank
on
follow-up
)

For
the
3382
patients
assigned
3
mg
warfarin
with
80
mg
aspirin
,
the
INR
results
were
:
at

1
(
n

2985
)
median
1.51
(
IQR

)
;
at
month
6
(
n

)
1.19
(
1.08-1.44
)

INTERPRETATION
:
Low
,
fixed-dose
warfarin
(
1
mg
or
3
mg
)
combined
with
low-dose
aspirin
(
80
mg
)
in
patients
who
have
had
myocardial

does
not
provide
clinical
benefit
beyond
that
achievable
with
160
mg
aspirin
monotherapy

BACKGROUND
:
There
is
serological
evidence
for
an
association
between
Chlamydia
pneumoniae
and
coronary
heart
disease

We
investigated
the
hypothesis
that
an
antichlamydial
macrolide
antibiotic
,
roxithromycin
,
can
prevent
or
reduce
recurrent
major
ischaemic
events
in
patients
with
unstable
angina

METHODS
:
The
effect
of
roxithromycin
was
assessed
in
a
double-blind
,
randomised
,
prospective
,
multicentre
,
parallel-group
,
placebo-controlled
pilot
study
of
202
patients
with
unstable
angina
or
non-Q-wave
myocardial
infarction

Patients
were
randomly
assigned
either
roxithromycin
150
mg
orally
twice
a
day
(
n
=
102
)
or
placebo
orally
twice
a
day
(
n
=
100
)

The
treatment
was
for
30
days

Patients
were
followed
up
for
6
months

We
report
the
primary
clinical
endpoints
(
cardiac
ischaemic
death
,
myocardial
infarction
,
and
severe
recurrent
ischaemia
)
,
assessed
at
day
31
,
in
202
patients
on
an
intention-to-treat
basis

FINDINGS
:
A
statistically
significant
reduction
in
the
primary
composite
triple
endpoint
rates
was
observed
in
the
roxithromycin
group
:
p
=
0.032

The
rate
of
severe
recurrent
ischaemia
,
myocardial
infarction
,
and
ischaemic
death
was
5.4
%
,
2.2
%
,
and
2.2
%
in
the
placebo
group
and
1.1
%
,
0
%
,
and
0
%
,
in
the
roxithromycin
group
,
respectively

No
major
drug-related
adverse
effects
were
observed

INTERPRETATION
:
Antichlamydial
antibiotics
may
be
useful
in
therapeutic
intervention
in
addition
to
standard
medication
in
patients
with
coronary-artery
disease

Large-scale
trials
are
needed
to
confirm
these
preliminary
observations

BACKGROUND
:
Stage
Ib
and
IIa
cervical
carcinoma
can
be
cured
by
radical
surgery
or
radiotherapy

These
two
procedures
are
equally
effective
,
but
differ
in
associated
morbidity
and
type
of
complications

In
this
prospective
randomised
trial
of
radiotherapy
versus
surgery
,
our
aim
was
to
assess
the
5-year
survival
and
the
rate
and
pattern
of
complications
and
recurrences
associated
with
each
treatment

METHODS
:
Between
September
,
1986
,
and
December
,
1991
,
469
women
with
newly
diagnosed
stage
Ib
and
IIa
cervical
carcinoma
were
referred
to
our
institute

343
eligible
patients
were
randomised
:
172
to
surgery
and
171
to
radical
radiotherapy

Adjuvant
radiotherapy
was
delivered
after
surgery
for
women
with
surgical
stage
pT2b
or
greater
,
less
than
3
mm
of
safe
cervical
stroma
,
cut-through
,
or
positive
nodes

The
primary
outcome
measures
were
5-year
survival
and
the
rate
of
complications

The
analysis
of
survival
and
recurrence
was
by
intention
to
treat
and
analysis
of
complications
was
by
treatment
delivered

FINDINGS
:
170
patients
in
the
surgery
group
and
167
in
the
radiotherapy
group
were
included
in
the
intention-to-treat
analysis
;
scheduled
treatment
was
delivered
to
169
and
158
women
,
respectively
,
62
of
114
women
with
cervical
diameters
of
4
cm
or
smaller
and
46
of
55
with
diameters
larger
than
4
cm
received
adjuvant
therapy

After
a
median
follow-up
of
87
(
range
57-120
)
months
,
5-year
overall
and
disease-free
survival
were
identical
in
the
surgery
and
radiotherapy
groups
(
83
%
and
74
%
,
respectively
,
for
both
groups
)
,
86
women
developed
recurrent
disease
:
42
(
25
%
)
in
the
surgery
group
and
44
(
26
%
)
in
the
radiotherapy
group

Significant
factors
for
survival
in
univariate
and
multivariate
analyses
were
:
cervical
diameter
,
positive
lymphangiography
,
and
adeno-carcinomatous
histotype

48
(
28
%
)
surgery-group
patients
had
severe
morbidity
compared
with
19
(
12
%
)
radiotherapy-group
patients
(
p
=
0.0004
)

INTERPRETATION
:
There
is
no
treatment
of
choice
for
early-stage
cervical
carcinoma
in
terms
of
overall
or
disease-free
survival

The
combination
of
surgery
and
radiotherapy
has
the
worst
morbidity
,
especially
urological
complications

The
optimum
therapy
for
each
patient
should
take
account
of
clinical
factors
such
as
menopausal
status
,
age
,
medical
illness
,
histological
type
,
and
cervical
diameter
to
yield
the
best
cure
with
minimum
complications

This

discusses
many
of
the
nutritional
topics
important
to
the
intensivist

Nutritional
assessment
,
substrate
immunonutrition
,
and
disease
specific
issues
are
presented

Early
introduction
of
enteral
feeds
and
the
use
of
nutritional
modulation
are
emphasized

PROBLEM
:
To
compare
the
expression
by
T-lymphocytes
of
an
immunomodulatory
protein
known
as
progesterone-induced
blocking
factor
(
PIBF
)
in
conception
versus
non-conception
cycles
even
when
there
has
been
definite
fertilization
and
embryo
formation

METHOD
:
PIBF
expression
on
T
lymphocytes
was
measured
using
an
immunohistochemical
method
with
a
PIBF-specific
polyclonal
antibody

These
levels
were
determined
in
patients
undergoing
three
types
of
therapy
:
non-in
vitro
fertilization
(
IVF
)
,
IVF-embryo
transfer
(
ET
)
,
and
frozen
ET

Sera
were
drawn
12
days
from
ovulation
in
non-IVF
cycles
or
9
days
after
ET
and
were
assayed
for
PIBF
and
beta
human
chorionic
gondotropin

Comparison
of
the
frequency
of
lymphocyte
expression
of
PIBF
in
pregnant
versus
non-pregnant
women
were
made

RESULTS
:
PIBF
was
detected
in
29.5
%
of
non-pregnant
women
and
52.5
%
of
pregnant
women

There
were
no
differences
in
PIBF
levels
by
therapy
used
in
non-pregnant
cases
or
in
the
pregnant
group

CONCLUSION
:
These
data
are
consistent
with
the
hypothesis
that
maternal
expression
of
PIBF
in
T-lymphocytes
soon
after
trophoblast
invasion
may
depend
on
successful
implantation

Many
amino
acids
contain
an
asymmetric
centre
,
occurring
as
laevorotatory
,
L
,
or
dextrorotatory
,
D
,
compounds

It
is
generally
assumed
that
abiotic
synthesis
of
amino
acids
on
the
early
Earth
resulted
in
racemic
mixtures
(
L-
and
D-enantiomers
in
equal
abundance
)

But
the
origin
of
life
required
,
owing
to
conformational
constraints
,
the
almost
exclusive
selection
of
either
L-
or
D-enantiomers
,
and
the
question
of
why
living
systems
on
the
Earth
consist
of
L-enantiomers
rather
than
D-enantiomers
is
unresolved

A
substantial
fraction
of
the
organic
compounds
on
the
early
Earth
may
have
been
derived
from
comet
and
meteorite
impacts

It
has
been
reported
previously
that
amino
acids
in
the
Murchison
meteorite
exhibit
an
excess
of
L-enantiomers
,
raising
the
possibility
that
a
similar
excess
was
present
in
the
initial
inventory
of
organic
compounds
on
the
Earth

The
stable
carbon
isotope
compositions
of
individual
amino
acids
in
Murchison
support
an
extraterrestrial
origin
--
rather
than
a
terrestrial
overprint
of
biological
amino
acids-although
reservations
have
persisted

Here
we
show
that
individual
amino-acid
enantiomers
from
Murchison
are
enriched
in
15N
relative
to
their
terrestrial
counterparts
,
so
confirming
an
extraterrestrial
source
for
an
L-enantiomer
excess
in
the
Solar
System
that
may
predate
the
origin
of
life
on
the
Earth

Home

workers
face
an
increasing
risk
for

violence

A
proactive
preventive
approach
is
presented
that
suggests
strategies
to
use
during
the
previsit
phase
,
the
visit
experience
,
and
on
an
ongoing
basis

The
miracidia
of
Fasciola
hepatica
and
Trichobilharzia
ocellata
approach
their
host
snails
Lymnaea
truncatula
and
L.
stagnalis
by
increasing
their
rate
of
change
of
direction
(
RCD
)
in
increasing
gradients
of
snail-conditioned
water
(
SCW
)
,
and
they
perform
a
turnback
swimming
in
decreasing
gradients

Both
hostfinding
responses
in
both
species
were
induced
by
glycoconjugates
with
a
molecular
weight
of
>
30
kDa
that
were
sensitive
to
hydrolysis
with
pronase
E
and
oxidation
with
NaIO4

Alkaline
cleavage
revealed
that
they
contained
carbohydrates
linked
O-glycosidically
via
serine
and
N-acetylgalactosamine

Miracidia
clearly
preferred
SCW
from
their
specific
host
snail
versus
other
sympatric
snail
species
and
did
not
respond
to
water
conditioned
with
fish
,
tadpoles
,
or
leeches

Differences
in
the
chemical
characteristics
of
SCW
from
the
intermediate
hosts
L.
truncatula
and
L.
stagnalis
could
be
shown
by
sodium
dodecyl
sulfate-polyacrylamide
gel
electrophoresis
,
blotting
,
and
subsequent
carbohydrate
detection

The
first
step
of
purification
of
the
effective
signaling
SCW
components
from
both
snail
species
was
achieved
by
ion-exchange
chromatography

Black
patients
with
colon
cancer
in
the
Black/White
Cancer
Survival
Study
were
found
to
have
a
poorer
survival
than
white
patients

More
advanced-stage
disease
at
diagnosis
was
the
primary
determinant
,
accounting
for
60
%
of
the
excess
mortality

After
adjusting
for
stage
,
factors
such
as
poverty
,
other
socioeconomic
conditions
,
and
treatment
did
not
further
explain
the
remaining
survival
deficit

This
study

colon
adenocarcinoma
were
centrally
evaluated
by
a
gastrointestinal
pathologist
,
blinded
in
regard
to
the
age
,
race
,
and
sex
of
the
patients

Blacks
were
less
likely
to
have
poorly
differentiated
(
grade
3
)
tumors
(
odds
ratio
(
OR
)
,
0.44
;
95
%
confidence
interval
,
0.22-0.88
)
and
lymphoid
reaction
(
OR
,
0.49
;
95
%
confidence
interval
,
0.26-0.90
)
when
compared
with
whites

These
black/white
(
B/W
)
differences
remained
statistically
significant
after
adjusting
for
age
,
sex
,
metropolitan
area
,
summary
stage
,
socioeconomic
status
,
body
mass
index
,
and
health
care
access
and
utilization

In
addition
,
blacks
were
less
likely
to
have
high-grade
(
grade
3
)
nuclear
atypia
,
mitotic
activity
,
and
tubule
formation
,
although
these
ORs
did
not
reach
a
statistical
significance
level
of
0.05

Similar
B/W
differences
were
observed
for
patients
with
advanced
disease
but
not
with
early
stage

Comparison
by
anatomical
subsite
showed
that
blacks
had
statistically
significantly
better
differentiated
tumors
for
cancers
of
the
proximal
and
transverse
colon
but
not
for
the
distal

No
racial
differences
were
found
for
blood
vessel
and
lymphatic
invasion
,
necrosis
,
fibrosis
,
and
mucinous
type
of
histology

The
findings
,
therefore
,
are
the
opposite
of
those
hypothesized

After
adjusting
for
stage
,
more
aggressive
tumor
characteristics
do
not
explain
the
adverse
survival
differential
in
blacks

This
suggests
that
there
may
be
racial
differences
in
environmental
exposure
,
and
that
the
intensity
and
mode
of
delivery
of
carcinogen
insult
as
well
as
host
susceptibility
may
differ
by
race
and
anatomical
subsite

Future
studies
should
explore
the
B/W
differences
in
tumor
biology
using
molecular
markers
that
precede
the
conventional
histological
parameters
evaluated
here

A
new
method
is
described
for
detection
of
mutations
in
the
lysosomal
alpha-glucosidase
gene
(
GAA
)
leading
to
Glycogen
Storage
Disease
type
II
(
GSDII
)

A
key
feature
of
the
method
is
isolation
and
reverse
transcription
of
mRNA
followed
by
PCR
amplification
of
lysosomal
alpha-glucosidase
cDNA
with
M13-extended
primers

Dye
labeled
primers
are
used
for
cycle
sequencing
and
an
ABI
PRISM
377
DNA
sequencing
system
for
analysis

The
method
is
rapid
and
complementary
to
the
automated
sequencing
of
all
the
19
,
PCR
amplified
,
coding
exons
of
the
GAA
gene

The
advantages
and
pitfalls
of
this
new
method
are
discussed
in
the
light
of
the
results
obtained
with
an
infantile
GSDII
patient

A
new
splice
site
mutation
in
the
GAA
gene
of
this
patient
was
identified
,
IVS16
(
+2T
--
>
C
)
,
resulting
in
the
deletion
of
16
base
pairs
of
exon
16

The
presence
of
clinical
autonomic
dysfunction
in
patients
with
neurologic
diseases
,
such
as
multiple
sclerosis
,
Parkinson
's
disease
,
and
cerebrovascular
accident
,
has
become
increasingly
recognized
in
the
past
decade

Very
few
autonomic
tests
have
been
done
on
pediatric
patients
thus
far

The
purpose
of
this
study
was
to
investigate
the
autonomic
function
in
patients
with
cerebral
palsy
using
two
noninvasive
tests
:
sympathetic
skin
response
(
SSR
)
and
R-R
interval
variation
(
RRIV
)

Twenty-four
patients
with
cerebral
palsy
and
24
control
subjects
between
the
ages
of
4
and
12
yr
were
enrolled
in
this
study

There
was
no
significant
difference
of
mean
latency
,
amplitude
,
or
amplitude
ratio
of
SSR
between
the
two
groups
under
electric
stimulus
,
startling
stimulus
,
and
deep
breathing
conditions

No
significant
difference
in
frequency
of
absent
response
and
asymmetric
response
was
also
noted

Mean
heart
rate
under
relaxed
sitting
condition
was
significantly
higher
in
the
study
group

Significant
negative
correlation
between
heart
rate
and
age
was
noted
in
the
control
group
but
was
not
present
in
the
study
group

Also
,
there
was
no
statistical
difference
of
mean
RRIV
between
the
two
groups

No
objective
evidence
of
autonomic
disturbance
in
patients
with
cerebral
palsy
was
found
in
this
study

A
two-credits
per
semester
clinical
medicine
course
was
established
in
the
Department
of
Physical
Medicine
and
Rehabilitation
(
PM
&
#

;
R
)
in
cooperation
with
the
Johns
Hopkins
University
undergraduate
Human
Biology
faculty
to
present
the
variety
of
inpatient
consultation
personnel
,
units
,
patient
diagnostic
groups
,
and
functional
problems

College
students
spend
4
hr
weekly
on
the
PM
&

;
R
consultation
service
as
team
members
under
resident
supervision

The
curriculum
emphasizes
student
understanding
of
the
roles
of
rehabilitation
team
members

Objectives
include
demonstration
of
working
knowledge
of
the
Biopsychosocial
Model
,
the
World
Health
Organization
Model
of
disablement
and
interdisciplinary
rehabilitation
intervention

The
course
includes
simulations
of
physical
impairments
,
demonstrations
of
adaptive
equipment
,
interactive
chart
reviews
,
readings
,
and
audio
lectures

A
retrospective
sequential
review
was
made
of
the
last
100
physical
medicine
and
rehabilitation
consultations
with
student
attendance

The
results
confirm
student
exposure
to
many
ward
settings
(
surgery
,
30
%
;
neurology/neurosurgery
,
28
%
;

,
and

)

The
rehabilitation
consultation
service
is
particularly
effective
as
an
introduction
to
hospital-based
medical
practice
due
to
the
diagnostic
variety
of
the
patients
,
the
functional
approach
of
rehabilitation
,
and
student
exposure
to
multiple
hospital
settings

The
Biopsychosocial
Model
of
medical
practice
is
demonstrated
through
multiple
interdisciplinary
perspectives
of
needs
and
interventions
for
patients
with
obvious
functional
deficits

This
process
develops
a
rudimentary
understanding
of
the
effect
of
illness
on
the
person
and
the
variety
of
medically
effective
therapeutic
modalities

This
study
is
designed
to
investigate
the
immediate
effectiveness
of
electrotherapy
on
myofascial
trigger
points
of
upper
trapezius
muscle

Sixty
patients
(
25
males
and
35
females
)
who
had
myofascial
trigger
points
in
one
side
of
the
upper
trapezius
muscles
were
studied

The
involved
upper
trapezius
muscles
were
treated
with
three
different
methods
according
to
a
random
assignment
:
group
A
muscles
(
n
=
18
)
were
given
placebo
treatment
(
control
group
)
;
group
B
muscles
(
n
=
20
)
were
treated
with
electrical
nerve
stimulation
(
ENS
)
therapy
;
and
group
C
muscles
(
n
=
22
)
were
given
electrical
muscle
stimulation
(
EMS
)
therapy

The
effectiveness
of
treatment
was
assessed
by
conducting
three
measurements
on
each
muscle
before
and
immediately
after
treatment
:
subjective
pain
intensity
(
(
PI
)
with
a
visual
analog
scale
)
,
pressure
pain
threshold
(
(
PT
)
with
algometry
)
,
and
range
of
motion
(
(
ROM
)
with
a
goniometer
)
of
upper
trapezius
muscle
(
lateral
bending
of
cervical
spine
to
the
opposite
side
)

When
the
effectiveness
of
treatment
was
compared
with
that
of
the
placebo
group
(
group
A
)
,
there
was
significant
improvement
in
PI
and
PT
in
group
B
(
P
&
#
60
;
0.01
)
but
not
in
group
C
(
P
>
0.05
)

The
improvement
of
ROM
was
significantly
more
in
group
C
(
P
&
#
60
;
0.01
)
as
compared
with
that
in
group
A
or
group
B

When
each
group
was
divided
into
two
additional
subgroups
based
on
the
initial
PI
,
it
was
found
that
ENS
could
reduce
PI
and
increase
PT
significantly
(
P
&
#
60
;
0.05
)
,
but
did
not
significantly
(
P
>
0.05
)
improve
ROM
,
as
compared
with
the
placebo
group
for
both
subgroups

EMS
could
significantly
(
P
&
#
60
;
0.05
)
improve
ROM
,
but
not
PT
,
better
than
the
placebo
groups
,
for
either
subgroup

It
could
reduce
PI
significantly
more
(
P
&
#
60
;
0.05
)
than
placebo
controls
only
for
the
subgroup
with
mild
to
moderate
pain
,
but
not
with
severe
pain

For
pain
relief
,
ENS
was
significantly
better
(
P
&
#
60
;
0.05
)
than
EMS
;
but
for
the
improvement
of
ROM
,
EMS
was
significantly
better
(
P
&
#
60
;
0.05
)
than
ENS

It
is
concluded
that
ENS
is
more
effective
for
immediate
relief
of
myofascial
trigger
point
pain
than
EMS
,
and
EMS
has
a
better
effect
on
immediate
release
of
muscle
tightness
than
ENS

Because
activity
and
regular
exercise
are
important
factors
to
maintain
general
good
health
in
senior
citizens
,
we
investigated
whether
senior
dancing
has
any
effect
on
peripheral
or
lumbar
bone
density

We
performed
a
prospective
study
over
a12-mo
period
on
bone
density
at
a
spinal
and
peripheral
measuring
site
in
28
female
senior
members
(
mean
age
:
67
+/-
2
yr
)
of
a
dancing
group
in
Vienna

Lumbar
bone
mineral
density
was
assessed
by
quantitative
computed
tomography
(
qCT
)
and
radial
bone
density
by
single
photon
absorptiometry
of
the
distal
forearm

The
mean
training
time
per
week
was
3.2
+/-
0.8
h.
In
the
entire
group
of
female
dancers
,
no
significant
effects
of
dancing
on
radial
or
lumbar
bone
density
could
be
observed

Linear
regression
analysis
showed
that
the
lower
the
qCT
at
the
beginning
of
the
observation
period
,
the
higher
was
the
percentage
increase
of
spinal
qCT
in
the
entire
group
during
12
mo
of
dancing
(
r
=
0.52
,
P
&
#
60
;
0.0001
)

For
additional
evaluation
,
females
were
divided
into
two
subgroups
,
osteoporotic
or
nonosteoporotic
,
based
on
x-rays
and
lumbar
bone
mineral
density
(
BMD
)
as
measured
by
qCT

The
group
classified
as
dancers
with
osteoporosis
(
group
I
)
showed
a
significant
increase
in
lumbar
bone
density
,
whereas
in
the
group
of
dancers
without
signs
of
osteoporosis
(
group
II
)
,
BMD
remained
unchanged

Additionally
,
radial
bone
density
did
not
show
any
changes
in
either
group

Group
I
showed
a
significant
correlation
between
basal
spinal
BMD
and
the
percentage
change
of
BMD
during
the
observation
period
(
r
=
0.7
,
P
&
#
60
;
0.001
)

Changes
of
the
biochemical
parameters
were
observed
in
the
bone-specific
isoenzyme
of
alkaline
phosphatase
,
a
marker
of
osteoblastic
activity
,
in
group
I
giving
additional
evidence
of
increased
bone
formation

OBJECTIVES
:
To
estimate
the
prevalence
of
Chlamydia
trachomatis
in
asymptomatic
women
attending
general
practice
:
to
assess
the
potential
of
the
ligase
chain
reaction
as
a
screening
tool
;
and
to
evaluate
selective
screening
criteria

DESIGN
:
Cross
sectional
survey

SETTING
:
Four
general
practices
in
northeast
London

SUBJECTS
:
890
women
aged
18-35
years
attending
general
practice
for
a
cervical
smear
or
a
``
young
well
woman
''
check
between
October
1994
and
January
1996

The
women
were
tested
for
C
trachomatis
with
confirmed
enzyme
immunoassay
(
endocervical
specimens
)
and
ligase
chain
reaction
assay
on
urine
specimens

MAIN
OUTCOME
MEASURES
:
Prevalence
of
C
trachomatis
infection
in
women
aged
18-35
on
the
basis
of
each
test
;
sensitivity
and
specificity
of
both
tests
in
this
population

RESULTS
:
Prevalence
of
confirmed
infection
was
2.6
%
(
95
%
confidence
interval
1.6
%
to
3.6
%
)
in
all
women

Prevalence
on
the
basis
of
enzyme
immunoassay
was
1.6
%
(
0.8
%
to
2.7
%
)
,
with
a
sensitivity
of
60
%
and
a
specificity
of
100
%

Prevalence
on
the
basis
of
ligase
chain
reaction
was
2.5
%
(
1.5
%
to
3.9
%
)
,
with
90
%
sensitivity
and
99.8
%
specificity

Screening
all
women
aged
&
#
60
;
or
=
25
and
all
women
who
had
had
two
or
more
partners
in
the
past
year
would
have
detected
87
%
(
20/23
)
of
infections

CONCLUSION
:
Ligase
chain
reaction
on
urine
samples
performs
at
least
as
well
as
enzyme
immunoassay
on
cervical
specimens
in
this
low
prevalence
population

It
offers
potential
as
a
non-invasive
screening
tool

A
simple
selective
screening
strategy
might
be
appropriate
and
would
be
able
to
detect
most
cases
of
infection

However
,
a
rigorous
economic
evaluation
of
possible
screening
strategies
is
needed
first

Recently
,
many
advances
have
been
made
in
the
study
of
sexual
differentiation
,
including
the
discoveries
of
the
gene
for
antim1/4llerian
hormone
as
well
as
the
gene
for
its
receptor

However
,
the
etiology
of
the
clinical
syndrome
of
m1/4llerian
agenesis
remains
elusive

We
hypothesize
that
activating
mutations
of
either
the
antim1/4llerian
hormone
gene
or
its
receptor
gene
may
cause
m1/4llerian
duct
regression
in
a
genetic
female
during
embryogenesis

This
clinical
commentary
discusses
the
current
management
of
the
syndrome
including
the
Abbe-McIndoe
procedure
,
the
most
commonly
used
method
of
surgical
correction
,
and
the
Frank
vaginal
dilation
method
,
the
most
common
nonsurgical
method
of
correction

OBJECTIVES
:
Obesity
is
an
important
clinical
problem
,
and
the
use
of
dexfenfluramine
hydrochloride
for
weight
reduction
has
been
widely
publicized
since
its
approval
by
the
Food
and
Drug
Administration

However
,
animal
and
human
studies
have
demonstrated
toxic
effects
of
fenfluramines
that
clinicians
should
be
aware
of
when
considering
prescribing
the
drugs

Our
purpose
was
to
systematically
review
data
on
brain
serotonin
neurotoxicity
in
animals
treated
with
fenfluramines
and
the
evidence
linking
fenfluramines
to
primary
pulmonary
hypertension
(
PPH
)

STUDY
SELECTION
:
Reports
dealing
with
long-term
effects
of
fenfluramines
on
brain

,
body

,
and
pulmonary
function
in

and
humans

DATA
EXTRACTION
:
Reports
were
reviewed
by
individuals
with
expertise
in
serotonin
neurobiology
,
neurotoxicity
,
neuropsychiatry
,
and
pulmonary
medicine
and
evaluated
for
appropriateness
for
inclusion
in
this
review

DATA
SYNTHESIS
:
Fenfluramines
cause
dose-related
,
long-lasting
reductions
in
serotonin
axonal
markers
in
all
the
animal
species
tested
and
with
all
the
routes
of
drug
administration
used

Doses
of
fenfluramines
that
produce
signs
of
brain
serotonin
neurotoxicity
in
animals
are
on
the
same
order
as
those
used
to
treat
humans
for
weight
loss
when
one
takes
into
account
known
relations
between
body
mass
and
drug
clearance

However
,
no
human
studies
have
been
conducted
,
and
the
pathological
and
clinical
potential
for
neurotoxicity
in
humans
is
unknown

Appetite
suppressants-most
commonly
fenfluramines
-increase
the
risk
of
developing
PPH
(
odds
ratio
,
6.3
)
,
particularly
when
used
for
more
than
3
months
(
odds
ratio
,
>
20
)

CONCLUSIONS
:
Fenfluramine
and
dexfenfluramine
have
been
demonstrated
to
damage
brain
serotonin
neurons
in
animal
studies

It
is
not
known
if
such
damage
occurs
in
humans
or
if
there
are
clinical
consequences

Use
of
fenfluramines
is
associated
with
an
increased
risk
of
PPH

Future
studies
should
address
the
long-term
consequences
of
prolonged
use
of
fenfluramines

This
article
discusses
dental
anxiety
and
phobia

The
author
presents
background
information
,
including
incidence
and
etiology

A
discussion
of
evaluative
techniques
for
assessing
anxiety
levels
follows

Examination
and
treatment
planning
are
considered
in
relation
to
this
patient
's
special
needs

The
article
stresses
behavioral
treatment
modalities
that
eliminate
the
debilitating
phobia

In
closing
,
the
author
presents
practical
information
regarding
prevention
of
dental
phobia
and
the
merits
of
incorporating
this
type
of
patient
into
a
dental
practice

In
order
to
evaluate
the
applicability
of
anthelminthic
treatment
of
wild
foxes
(
Vulpes
vulpes
)
to
limit
their
infection
with
Echinococcus
multilocularis
,
bait
pellets
,
each
containing
50
mg
praziquantel
,
were
repeatedly
distributed
in
an
area
of
566
km2
where
many
foxes
are
infected
,
in
southern
Germany

After
six
baiting
campaigns
(
15-20
baits/km2
)
over
a
period
of
14
months
,
the
prevalence
of
the
cestode
in
foxes
,
initially
32
%
,
had
fallen
to
4
%

The
effect
was
most
pronounced
in
the
central
part
of
the
treated
area
,
where
no
positive
fox
was
found
in
the
2
months
before
the
end
of
the
trial

The
study
was
controlled
for
other
factors
that
could
influence
the
parasite
's
prevalence
,
such
as
the
availability
of
intermediate
hosts

While
the
potential
of
this
baiting
method
to
remove
E

multilocularis
from
wild
hosts
has
been
demonstrated
,
the
question
of
its
long-term
efficacy
and
other
unresolved
problems
have
to
be
addressed
by
consecutive
studies
before
routine
application
can
be
recommended

In
patients
with
chronic
myeloid
leukemia
(
CML
)
,
the
neoplastic
(
BCR-ABL+
)
progenitor
cells
are
characterized
by
an
increased
proliferative
activity

Whether
these
cells
are
also
resistant
to
apoptosis
and
if
so
,
under
what
conditions
remains
controversial

We
now
show
that
highly
purified
populations
of
very
primitive
neoplastic
progenitor
cells
obtained
directly
from
CML
patients
survive
and
proliferate
in
vitro
for
several
weeks
in
the
absence
of
any
added
growth
factors
(
except
insulin
)

In
contrast
,
purified
primary
normal
progenitors
maintained
under
the
same
conditions
die
rapidly

Nevertheless
,
both
primary
CML
cells
and
BCR-ABL+
BAF3
cells
show
the
same
dose-dependent
sensitivity
to
TNF-alpha
or
ceramide-induced
apoptosis
as
their
respective
normal
counterparts

In
fact
,
time
course
studies
demonstrated
an
even
faster
onset
of
apoptosis
in
ceramide-treated
BCR-ABL+
BAF3
cells
as
compared
to
normal
controls

BCR-ABL+
cells
treated
with
ceramide
also
showed
a
rapid
and
sequential
increase
in
the
tyrosine
phosphorylation
of
p210
(
BCR-ABL
)
,
p46-56SHC
and
p120Cbl

These
findings
suggest
growth
factor
deprivation
and
treatment
with
TNF-alpha
or
ceramide
trigger
different
initial
events
both
of
which
can
lead
to
apoptosis
in
factor-dependent
hematopoietic
cells

However
,
in
the
first
case
,
activation
of
apoptosis
is
blocked
by
the
basal
activity
of
p210
(
BCR-ABL
)
,
whereas
in
the
second
,
the
presence
of
p210
(
BCR-ABL
)
appears
to
accelerate
the
onset
of
apoptosis
by
a
mechanism
that
may
involve
an
activation
of
its
kinase
function

Clinically
,
the
hallmark
of
the
human
amnesic
syndrome
is
an
impaired
ability
to
consciously
recollect
or
remember
daily
events

If
the
medial
region
of
the
temporal
lobes
,
including
the
hippocampus
and
related
structures
,
is
critical
for
establishing
these
new
memories
,
then
this
brain
region
should
be
active
whenever
events
are
experienced
,
regardless
of
whether
subjects
are
asked
explicitly
to
learn
and
remember

Here
we
show
that
the
medial
temporal
region
is
active
during
encoding
and
that
the
hemisphere
activated
and
the
amount
of
activation
depend
on
the
type
of
stimulus
presented
(
objects
or
words
)
,
whether
the
stimulus
can
be
encoded
for
meaning
(
real
objects
and
words
versus
nonsense
objects
and
words
)
,
and
task
experience
(
first
versus
the
second
time
a
task
is
performed
)

These
findings
demonstrate
that
the
medial
temporal
lobe
memory
system
is
engaged
automatically
when
we
attend
to
a
perceptual
event
and
that
the
location
and
amount
of
activation
depend
on
stimulus
characteristics
(
physical
form
,
meaning
)
and
experience

The
involvement
of
structures
in
the
medial
temporal
lobe
during
the
encoding
of
visual
associations
was
studied
with
functional
magnetic
resonance
imaging

In
11
out
of
12
normal
healthy
volunteers
this
task
resulted
in
activation
in
posterior
portions
of
the
parahippocampal
region
,
close
to
the
collateral
sulcus

In
seven
subjects
activation
was
encountered
in
the
hippocampal
formation

The
visual
association
task
as
adapted
for
this
study
may
provide
a
sensitive
measure
to
study
anterograde
amnesia
prevalent
in
Alzheimer
's
disease

Therefore
,
the
present
paradigm
enables
the
study
of
individual
changes
in
learning
and
memory
capacities
over
time

Altered
calcium
(
Ca2+
)
homeostasis
is
thought
to
play
a
key
role
in
aging
and
neuropathology
resulting
in
memory
deficits

Several
forms
of
hippocampal
synaptic
plasticity
are
dependent
on
Ca2+
,
providing
a
potential
link
between
altered
Ca2+
homeostasis
and
memory
deficits
associated
with
aging

The
current
study
reviews
evidence
for
Ca2+
dysregulation
during
aging
which
could
interact
with
Ca
(
2+
)
-dependent
synaptic
plasticity

The
authors
suggest
that
changes
in
Ca2+
regulation
could
adjust
the
thresholds
for
synaptic
modification
,
favoring
processes
for
depression
of
synaptic
strength
during
aging

Transiently
evolked
otoacoustic
emissions
(
TEOAE
)
have
been
reported
in
several
studies
as
absent
in
a
small
minority
of
normal
ears

Other
studies
have
reported
TEOAEs
in
all
normal
ears

Differences
between
studies
may
arise
directly
from
criteria
for
TEOAE
identification
,
criteria
for
selection
of
normals
,
or
statistically
due
to
limited
sample
sizes

In
order
to
understand
and
model
cochlear
processes
involved
in
TEOAE
generation
,
it
needs
to
be
known
whether
the
presence
of
normal
hearing
leads
automatically
to
generation
of
TEOAEs

The
present
study
set
out
to
establish
in
a
large
sample
if
any
ears
could
be
found
that
lacked
TEOAEs
despite
normal
hearing
threshold
levels
(
HTL
)

A
total
of
397
ears
from
highly
cooperative
adult
subjects
were
examined
under
laboratory
conditions

Using
cross
correlation
between
replicate
nonlinear
waveforms
as
the
criterion
,
TEOAEs
were
present
in
99.2
%
of
the
sample
(
lower
CI
98.1
%
)

However
,
careful
visual
assessment
of
the
recorded
waveforms
for
the
remaining
ears
did
not
unequivocally
show
absence
of
TEOAE
characteristics
in
any
ear
with
normal
HTLs

While
TEOAE
strength
varies
widely
among
ears
,
no
clear
evidence
was
found
to
show
that
TEOAEs
can
be
absent
when
HTLs
are
normal

In
addition
to
a
long
form
of
591
amino
acids
(
aa
)
,
two
other
forms
of
PRL
receptor
(
PRLR
)
,
differing
in
the
length
of
their
cytoplasmic
domains
,
have
been
identified
in
the
rat

The
Nb2
form
,
lacking
198
aa
in
the
cytoplasmic
domain
,
is
able
to
transmit
a
lactogenic
signal
similar
to
the
long
form
,
whereas
the
short
form
of
291
aa
is
inactive

The
ability
of
PRL
to
activate
the
promoter
of
the
beta-casein
gene
or
the
lactogenic
hormone
responsive
element
fused
to
the
luciferase
reporter
was
assessed
in
Chinese
hamster
ovary
cells
or
293
fibroblasts
transiently
transfected
with
PRLR
cDNAs

The
function
of
the
short
form
was
examined
after
cotransfection
of
both
the
long
and
short
forms

These
results
clearly
show
that
the
short
form
acts
as
a
dominant
negative
inhibitor
through
the
formation
of
inactive
heterodimers
,
resulting
in
an
inhibition
of
Janus
kinase
2
(
JAK2
)
activation

The
present
study
also
investigates
the
possible
participation
of
cytoplasmic
receptors
in
the
signal
transduction
pathway
,
using
cotransfection
experiments
and
a
new
approach
that
selectively
determines
the
contribution
of
cytoplasmic
receptors
in
the
process
of
signal
transduction

We
cotransfected
Chinese
hamster
ovary
cells
with
two
cDNA
constructs
:
a
cytoplasmic
(
soluble
)
form
of
the
receptor
with
a
deleted
signal
peptide
(
delta-19
)
,
which
is
unable
to
bind
PRL
,
and
a
functionally
inactive
receptor
mutant
(
lacking
box
1
)
,
which
is
anchored
in
the
plasma
membrane
and
able
to
bind
PRL

This
approach
has
allowed
us
to
show
that
delta-19
,
lacking
expression
at
the
plasma
membrane
,
can
transduce
the
hormonal
message
,
at
least
to
a
limited
extent
(
up
to
30
%
of
wild
type
efficiency
)
,
providing
that
association/activation
occurs
with
a
PRL-PRLR
complex
initiated
at
the
cell
surface
level
;
box
1
of
the
cytoplasmic
form
is
necessary
to
rescue
this
partial
transcriptional
activity
of
the
inactive
mutant

This
partial
recovery
is
also
parallel
to
the
partial
activation
of
JAK2
,
indicating
that
the
signal
transduction
pathway
implicated
JAK2

Our
results
provide
evidence
that
heterodimerization
of
receptors
can
be
implicated
either
in
the
positive
or
in
negative
activation
of
gene
transcription

BACKGROUND
:
Inadequate
dietary
intake
of
calcium
and
vitamin
D
may
contribute
to
the
high
prevalence
of
osteoporosis
among
older
persons

METHODS
:
We
studied
the
effects
of
three
years
of
dietary
supplementation
with
calcium
and
vitamin
D
on
bone
mineral
density
,
biochemical
measures
of
bone
metabolism
,
and
the
incidence
of
nonvertebral
fractures
in
176
men
and
213
women
65
years
of
age
or
older
who
were
living
at
home

They
received
either
500
mg
of
calcium
plus
700
IU
of
vitamin
D3
(
cholecalciferol
)
per
day
or
placebo

Bone
mineral
density
was
measured
by
dual-energy
x-ray
absorptiometry
,
blood
and
urine
were
analyzed
every
six
months
,
and
cases
of
nonvertebral
fracture
were
ascertained
by
means
of
interviews
and
verified
with
use
of
hospital
records

RESULTS
:
The
mean
(
+/-SD
)
changes
in
bone
mineral
density
in
the
calcium-vitamin
D
and
placebo
groups
were
as
follows
:
femoral
neck
,
+0.50+/-4.80
and
-0.70+/-5.03
percent
,
respectively
(
P=0.02
)
;
spine
,
+2.12+/-4.06
and
+1.22+/-4.25
percent
(
P=0.04
)
;
and
total
body
,
+0.06+/-1.83
and
-1.09+/-1.71
percent
(
P
&
#
60
;
0.001
)

The
difference
between
the
calcium-vitamin
D
and
placebo
groups
was
significant
at
all
skeletal
sites
after
one
year
,
but
it
was
significant
only
for
total-body
bone
mineral
density
in
the
second
and
third
years

Of
37
subjects
who
had
nonvertebral
fractures
,
26
were
in
the
placebo
group
and
11
were
in
the
calcium-vitamin
D
group
(
P=0.02
)

CONCLUSIONS
:
In
men
and
women
65
years
of
age
or
older
who
are
living
in
the
community
,
dietary
supplementation
with
calcium
and
vitamin
D
moderately
reduced
bone
loss
measured
in
the
femoral
neck
,
spine
,
and
total
body
over
the
three-year
study
period
and
reduced
the
incidence
of
nonvertebral
fractures

The
sterilization
and
contaminated
waste
disposal
practices
in
all
14
dental
clinics
operated
by
the
Southern
Sydney
Area
Health
Service
were
surveyed

All
of
the
clinics
used
autoclaves
for
sterilization

All
hand
instruments
,
handpieces
and
triplex
syringes
were
autoclaved
between
patients

Chemical
disinfection
solutions
were
used
in
12
of
the
14
dental
clinics
,
mainly
for
surface
decontamination

Five
dental
clinics
had
separate
storage
areas
for
contaminated
waste
which
compiled
with
contaminated
waste
separation
and
disposal
guidelines

The
practice
of
recapping
needles
with
fingers
and
some
inadequate
washing
facilities
are
areas
that
require
particular
attention

Safety
and
efficacy
are
crucial
but
separate
issues
for
vitamin
and
mineral
supplements

Misinterpretation
of
``
safe
and
adequate
''
to
mean
``
safety
limit
''
would
impose
restrictions
on
vitamin
and
mineral
intakes
that
are
not
needed
to
ensure
safety

Substantial
evidence
indicates
that
intakes
greater
than
the
recommended
dietary
allowances
(
RDAs
)
of
certain
vitamins
and
minerals
such
as
calcium
,
folic
acid
,
vitamin
E
,
selenium
,
and
chromium
reduce
the
risk
of
certain
diseases
for
some
people

Limitation
of
intakes
to
the
RDAs
would
preclude
reductions
in
disease
risk
from
these
nutrients

The
margin
of
safety
between
the
usual
dietary
intake
and
the
intake
that
would
produce
adverse
effects
varies
greatly
among
the
different
nutrients

Very
high
intakes
of
vitamins
A
and
D
,
niacin
,
pyridoxine
,
and
selenium
have
produced
adverse
effects

Many
widely
discussed
putative
adverse
effects
of
vitamin
C
,
vitamin
E
,
and
trivalent
chromium
have
little
factual
basis

There
is
no
evidence
of
adverse
effects
from
beta-carotene
supplements
except
in
current
heavy
smokers

The
mutator
hypothesis
of
tumorigenesis
suggests
that
loss
of
chromosomal
stability
or
maintenance
functions
results
in
elevated
mutation
rates
,
leading
to
the
accumulation
of
the
numerous
mutations
required
for
multistep
carcinogenesis

The
human
DNA
mismatch
repair
(
MMR
)
genes
are
highly
conserved
homologues
of
the
Escherichia
coli
MutHLS
system
,
which
contribute
to
genomic
stability
by
surveillance
and
repair
of
replication
misincorporation
errors
and
exogenous
DNA
damage

Mutations
in
one
of
these
MMR
genes
,
hMSH2
,
account
for
about
half
of
all
cases
of
genetically
linked
hereditary
non-polyposis
colorectal
cancer

Loss
of
function
of
p53
has
also
been
proposed
to
increase
cellular
hypermutability
,
thereby
accelerating
carcinogenesis
,
although
a
clear
role
for
p53
in
genomic
instability
remains
controversial

p53
is
mutated
frequently
in
a
wide
range
of
human
cancers
,
including
colonic
tumours

Both
Msh2-
and
p53-targeted
knockout
mice
are
viable
and
susceptible
to
cancer

Here
we
demonstrate
that
combined
Msh2
and
p53
ablation
(
Msh2-/-p53-/-
)
results
in
developmental
arrest
of
all
female
embryos
at
9.5
days

In
contrast
,
male
Msh2-/-p53-/-
mice
are
viable
,
but
succumb
to
tumours
significantly
earlier
(
t1-2
is
73
days
)
than
either
Msh2-/-
or
p53-/-
littermates

Furthermore
,
the
frequency
of
microsatellite
instability
(
MSI
)
in
tumours
from
Msh2-/-p53-/-
mice
is
not
significantly
different
than
in
Msh2-/-
mice

Synergism
in
tumorigenesis
and
independent
segregation
of
the
MSI
phenotype
suggest
that
Msh2
and
p53
are
not
genetically
epistatic

Our

models

The
LPL
model
defines
the
time
available
for
repair
of
PLD
(
t
(
rep
)
)
as
the
time
taken
to
reach
maximal
survival
in
a
delayed-plating
recovery
experiment

Those
data
show
that
after
this
time
has
elapsed
,
contrary
to
the
expectation
of
the
LPL
model
,
survival
can
be
increased
by
changing
the
medium
used
for
delayed
plating
from
fresh
growth
medium
to
conditioned
medium

According
to
the
RMR
model
,
all
potentially
lethal
lesions
should
also
be
committed
by
that
time
and
be
unavailable
for
repair
in
the

medium

Only

predicted
that
PLD
(
=
DSBs
)
would
still
be
available
for
repair
after
that
time

Second
,
data
for
split-dose
recovery
are
used
to
predict
the
first-order
kinetics
time
constant
for
DSB
repair
(
tau
(
DSBR
)
)
using
the
DSB
model
(
24
+/-
1.5
min
)

This
value
is
nearly
identical
to
the
value
of
27
+/-
1
min
determined
from
the
data
obtained
by
Cheong
et
al
.
using
pulsed-field
gel
electrophoresis
(
PFGE
)
(
Mutat

Res

274
,
111-122
,
1992
)

The
value
based
on
PFGE
is
used
to
calculate
the
value
of
t
(
rep
)
predicted
by
the
DSB
model
(
2.6
+/-
0.1
h
)
,
which
agrees
with
the
value
determined
experimentally
as
the
time
when
changing
the
delayed-plating
medium
from
growth
medium
to
conditioned
medium
no
longer
gives
the
full
recovery
seen
with
delayed
plating
in
conditioned
medium
(
2.5
h
)

However
,
some
recovery
was
seen
for
a
change
in
the
medium
(
growth
medium
to
conditioned
medium
)
up
to
5-6
h
postirradiation

Reanalysis
of
the
original
data
on
DSB
repair
shows
that
they
are
consistent
with
two
first-order
repair
rates
(
18
+/-
7
min
and
about
52
min
)

These
results
are
consistent
with
two
pools
of
DSBs
(
or
cells
)
,
each
with
their
own
t
(
rep
)

The
early
t
(
rep
)
,
associated
with
tau
(
fast
)
,
is
predicted
to
be
1.7
+/-
0.7
h
,
and
the
late
t
(
rep
)
,
associated
with
tau
(
slow
)
,
is
predicted
to
be
about
5
h.
Both
values
are
in
excellent
agreement
with
the
times
at
which
changing
from
growth
medium
to
conditioned
medium
no
longer
gives
the
full
recovery
seen
in
conditioned
medium
only
(
the
early
t
(
rep
)
)
,
and
the
time
when
changing
from
growth
medium
to
conditioned
medium
produces
no
further
increase
in
survival
(
the
late
t
(
rep
)
)
,
respectively

It
is
noted
that
attempts
to
correlate
radiosensitivity
with
the
rates
of
DSB
repair
,
rather
than
using
an
explicit
model
such
as
the
DSB
model
,
are
unlikely
to
be
productive
since
survival
depends
on
both
tau
(
DSBR
)
and
t
(
rep
)
(
as
defined
in
the
DSB
model
)
and
the
latter
may
be
the
more
important
determinant
of
radiosensitivity
(
as
it
appears
to
be
for
ataxia
telangiectasia
cells
compared
to
normal
fibroblasts
and
for
irs
compared
to
V79
cells

CONTEXT
:
Adolescents
'
concerns
about
privacy
in
clinical
settings
decrease
their
willingness
to
seek
health
care
for
sensitive
problems
and
may
inhibit
their

with
physicians

OBJECTIVE
:
To
investigate
the
influence
of
physicians
'
assurances
of
confidentiality
on
adolescents
'
willingness
to
disclose

DESIGN
:
Randomized

trial

SETTING
:
Three
suburban
public
high
schools
in
California

PARTICIPANTS
:
The
562
participating
adolescents
represented
92
%
of
students
in
mandatory
classes

INTERVENTION
:
After
random
assignment
to
1
of
3
groups
,
the
adolescents
listened
to
a
standardized
audiotape
depiction
of
an
office
visit
during
which
they
heard
a
physician
who
assured
unconditional
confidentiality
,
a
physician
who
assured
conditional
confidentiality
,
or
a
physician
who
did
not
mention
confidentiality

MAIN
OUTCOME
MEASURES
:
Adolescents

scenario
were
assessed
by
anonymous

RESULTS
:
Assurances
of
confidentiality
increased
the
number
of
adolescents
willing
to
disclose
sensitive
information
about
sexuality
,

from
39
%

When
comparing
the
unconditional

CONCLUSIONS
:
Adolescents
are
more
willing
to
communicate
with
and
seek
health
care
from
physicians
who
assure
confidentiality

Further
investigation
is
needed
to
identify
a
confidentiality

statement
that
explains
the
legal
and

BACKGROUND
:
Diabetic
foot
infections
cause
substantial
morbidity
and
mortality

Neutrophil
superoxide
generation
,
a
crucial
part
of
neutrophil
bactericidal
activity
,
is
impaired
in
diabetes

Granulocyte-colony
stimulating
factor
(
G-CSF
)
increases
the
release
of
neutrophils
from
the
bone
marrow
and
improves
neutrophil
function

We
assessed
G-CSF
as
adjuvant
therapy
for
the
treatment
of
severe
foot
infections
in
diabetic
patients

METHODS
:
40
diabetic
patients
with
foot
infections
were
enrolled
in
a
double-blind
placebo-controlled
study

On
admission
,
patients
were
randomly
assigned
G-CSF
(
filgrastim
)
therapy
(
n
=
20
)
or
placebo
(
n
=
20
)
for
7
days

Both
groups
received
similar
antibiotic
and
insulin
treatment

Neutrophils
from
the
peripheral
blood
of
these
participants
and
from
healthy
controls
were
stimulated
with
opsonised
zymosan
,
and
superoxide
production
was
measured
by
a
spectrophotometric
assay
(
reduction
of
ferricytochrome

)

FINDINGS
:
G-CSF
therapy
was
associated
with
earlier
eradication
of
pathogens
from
the
infected
ulcer
(

and
a

vs
14.5
(

No
G-CSF-treated
patient
needed
surgery
,
whereas
two
placebo
recipients
underwent
to
amputation
and
two
had
extensive
debridement
under
anaesthesia

After
7
days
'
treatment
,
neutrophil
superoxide
production
was
significantly
higher
in
the
G-CSF
group
than
in
the
placebo

G-CSF
therapy
was
generally
well
tolerated

INTERPRETATION
:
G-CSF
treatment
was
associated
with
improved
clinical
outcome
of
foot
infection
in
diabetic
patients

This
improvement
may
be
related
to
an
increase
in
neutrophil

production

BACKGROUND
:
Accelerated
infusion
of
alteplase
(
tissue
plasminogen
activator
)
over
a
period
of
90
minutes
induces
more
rapid
lysis
of
coronary-artery
thrombi
than
a
3-hour
infusion

With
two
bolus
doses
of
alteplase
,
further
shortening
the
duration
of
administration
,
complete
reperfusion
was
achieved
in
more
than
85
percent
of
the
patients
in
initial
angiographic
studies

We
tested
the
hypothesis
that
double-bolus
alteplase
is
at
least
as
effective
as
accelerated
infusion

METHODS
:
In
398
hospitals
,
7169
patients
with
acute
myocardial
infarction
were
randomly
assigned
to
weight-adjusted
,
accelerated
infusion
of
100
mg
of
alteplase
or
to
a
bolus
of
50
mg
of
alteplase
over
a
period
of
1
to
3
minutes
followed
30
minutes
later
by
a
second
bolus
of
50
mg
(
or
40
mg
for
patients
who
weighed
less
than
60
kg
)

The
primary
end
point
was
death
from
any
cause
at
30
days

The
trial
was
stopped
prematurely
because
of
concern
about
the
safety
of
the
double-bolus
injection

RESULTS
:
Thirty-day
mortality
was
higher
in
the
double-bolus
group
than
in
the
accelerated-infusion
group
:
7.98
percent
as
compared
with
7.53
percent

The
absolute
difference
was
0.44
percent
,
with
a
one-sided
95
percent
upper
boundary
of
1.49
percent
,
which
exceeded
the
prespecified
upper
limit
of
0.40
percent
to
indicate
equivalence
in
30-day
mortality
between
the
two
regimens

The
respective
rates
of
any
stroke
and
of
hemorrhagic
stroke
were
1.92
and
1.12
percent
after
double-bolus
alteplase
,
as
compared
with
1.53
and
0.81
percent
after
an
accelerated
infusion
of
alteplase
(
P=0.24
and
P=0.23
,
respectively
)

CONCLUSIONS
:
Double-bolus
alteplase
was
not
shown
to
be
equivalent
,
according
to
the
prespecified
criteria
,
to
accelerated
infusion
with
regard
to
30-day
mortality

There
was
also
a
slightly
higher
rate
of
intracranial
hemorrhage
with
the
double-bolus
method

Therefore
,
accelerated
infusion
of
alteplase
over
a
period
of
90
minutes
remains
the
preferred
regimen

BACKGROUND
:
Fenfluramine
and
phentermine
have
been
individually
approved
as
anorectic
agents
by
the
Food
and
Drug
Administration
(
FDA
)

When
used
in
combination
the
drugs
may
be
just
as
effective
as
either
drug
alone
,
with
the
added
advantages
of
the
need
for
lower
doses
of
each
agent
and
perhaps
fewer
side
effects

Although
the
combination
has
not
been
approved
by
the
FDA
,
in
1996
the
total
number
of
prescriptions
in
the
United
States
for
fenfluramine
and
phentermine
exceeded
18
million

<

METHODS
:
We
identified
valvular
heart
diseasein
24
women
treated
with
fenfluramine-phentermine
who
had
no
history
of
cardiac
disease

The
women
presented
with
cardiovascular
symptoms
or
a
heart
murmur

As
increasing
numbers
of
these
patients
with
similar
clinical
features
were
identified
,
there
appeared
to
be
an
association
between
these
features
and
fenfluramine-phentermine
therapy

RESULTS
:
Twenty-four
women
(
mean
(
+/-SD
)
age
,
44+/-8
years
)
were
evaluated
12.3+/-7.1
months
after
the
initiation
of
fenfluramine-phentermine
therapy

Echocardiography
demonstrated
unusual
valvular
morphology
and
regurgitation
in
all
patients

Both
right-sided
and
left-sided
heart
valves
were
involved

Eight
women
also
had
newly
documented
pulmonary
hypertension

To
date
,
cardiac
surgical
intervention
has
been
required
in
five
patients

The
heart
valves
had
a
glistening
white
appearance

Histopathological
findings
included
plaque-like
encasement
of
the
leaflets
and
chordal
structures
with
intact
valve
architecture

The
histopathological
features
were
identical
to
those
seen
in
carcinoid
or
ergotamine-induced
valve
disease

CONCLUSIONS
:
These
cases
arouse
concern
that
fenfluramine-phentermine
therapy
may
be
associated
with
valvular
heart
disease

Candidates
for
fenfluramine-phentermine
therapy
should
be
informed
about
serious
potential
adverse
effects
,
including
pulmonary
hypertension
and
valvular
heart
disease

Between
1987
and
1992
,
all
patients
presenting
to
the
senior
author
with
a
symptomatic
failed
silicone
implant
arthroplasty
refractory
to
conservative
treatment
were
converted
to
a
metatarsophalangeal
joint
arthrodesis

Internal
fixation
was
achieved
with
either
dual
intrameduilary
threaded
Steinmann
pins
or
an
obliquely
placed
AO
compression
screw
and
a
three-
or
four-hole
one-third
tubular
dorsal
neutralization
plate

Bone
grafting
was
used
to
maintain
hallux
length

Successful
arthrodesis
was
achieved
in
all
five
feet
in
patients
with
rheumatoid
arthritis

Subjectively
,
patients
improved
from
an
average
of
0.69
before
arthrodesis
to
4.89
after
arthrodesis

The
average
walking
tolerance
improved
from
1.11
to
4.80
,
and
the
overall
level
of
satisfaction
improved
from
0.0
to
4.79

The
patient
's
ability
to
wear
shoes
improved
from
0.87
to
3.1

Successful
arthrodesis
produces
a
foot
that
is
more
functional
and
durable
than
excisional
arthroplasty

Subjectively
,
these
patients
stated
that
their
level
of
pain
,
walking
tolerance
,
and
overall
satisfaction
improved
significantly
after
the
arthrodesis

Clinically
,
there
was
no
evidence
of
transfer
lesions
,
tenderness
,
or
hallux
subluxation

Hallux
length
was
well
maintained
after
surgery
with
bone
grafting
,
but
it
was
more
difficult
to
obtain
the
alignment
goals

The
average
postoperative
metatarsophalangeal
dorsiflexion
angle
was
15.6
degrees
and
the
first
metatarsophalangeal
angle
was
3.1
degrees

Despite
this
,
patient
satisfaction
was
high

Arthrodesis
of
the
first
metatarsophalangeal
joint
using
a
bone
graft
to
salvage
failed
silicone
implant
arthroplasty
produces
acceptable
subjective
and
radiographic
results

Although
technically
demanding
,
it
provides
long-term
stability
to
the
hallux
,
restores
weightbearing
,
and
allows
for
maintenance
of
a
propulsive
gait

We
recommend
this
procedure
instead
of
an
excisional
arthroplasty
to
maintain
high
level
of
function
and
overall
patient
satisfaction

RESULTS
:
The
crude

rate
was
estimated
to
be
30.7
per
100000
(
95
%
confidence
interval
27.1-34.4

and
the
standardised

victims
were
below
the
age
of
54
years

Thirty-five
per

of
patients
died
within

Overall
,
the
age-specific

years
whose
mothers
were
randomly
assigned
during
pregnancy
to
receive
2
g/day
of
elemental
calcium
(
n

MAIN
OUTCOME
MEASURES
:
Mean
blood
pressure
and
rate
of
high

pressure
of
children

RESULTS
:
Overall
,
systolic

was
lower
in
the
calcium
group
(
mean
difference
-1.4
mm
Hg
;
95
%
confidence
interval
-3.2
to
0.5
)
than
in
the
placebo
group

The
effect
was
found
predominantly
among
children
whose
body
mass
index
at
assessment
was
above
the
median
for
this
population
(
mean

)
for
those
with
an

)

The
risk
of
high
systolic
blood
pressure
was
also
lower
in
the
calcium
group
than
in
the
placebo
group
(
relative
risk
0.59
;
0.39

and
particularly
among
children
in
the

CONCLUSION
:
Calcium
supplementation
during
pregnancy
is
associated
with
lower
systolic
blood
pressure
in
the
offspring
,
particularly
among
overweight
children

The
fast
reaction
of
peroxynitrite
with
CO2
and
the
high
concentration
of
dissolved
CO2
in
vivo
(
ca

1
mM
)
suggest
that
CO2
modulates
most
of
the
reactions
of
peroxynitrite
in
biological
systems

The
addition
of
peroxynitrite
to
CO2
produces
of
the
adduct
ONOO-CO2-
(
1
)

The
production
of
1
greatly
accelerates
the
decomposition
of
peroxynitrite
to
give
nitrate

We
now
show
that
the
formation
of
1
is
followed
by
reformation
of
CO2
(
rather
than
another
carbonate
species
such
as
CO3
=
or
HCO3-
)

To
show
this
,
it
is
necessary
to
study
systems
with
limiting
concentrations
of
CO2

(
When
CO2
is
present
in
excess
,
its
concentration
remains
nearly
constant
during
the
decomposition
of
peroxynitrite
,
and
the
recycling
of
CO2
,
although
it
occurs
,
can
not
be
detected
kinetically
)

We
find
that
CO2
is
a
true
catalyst
of
the
decomposition
of
peroxynitrite
,
and
this
fundamental
insight
into
its
action
must
be
rationalized
by
any
in
vivo
or
in
vitro
reaction
mechanism
that
is
proposed

When
the
concentration
of
CO2
is
lower
than
that
of
peroxynitrite
,
the
reformation
of
CO2
amplifies
the
fraction
of
peroxynitrite
that
reacts
with
CO2

Even
low
concentrations
of
CO2
that
result
from
the
dissolution
of
ambient
CO2
can
have
pronounced
catalytic
effects

These
effects
can
cause
deviations
from
predicted
kinetic
behavior
in
studies
of
peroxynitrite
in
noncarbonate
buffers
in
vitro
,
and
since
1
and
other
intermediates
derived
from
it
are
oxidants
and/or
nitrating
agents
,
some
of
the
reactions
attributed
to
peroxynitrite
may
depend
on
the
availability
of
CO2

A
prospective
,
randomized
,
placebo-controlled
,
double-blind
,
parallel-group
,
6-month
study
assessed
the
efficacy
and
safety
of
ropinirole
,
a
nonergoline
D2-dopamine
agonist
,
in
patients
with
early
Parkinson
's
disease
(

stages

to

)
with
limited
or
no
prior
dopaminergic
therapy

Patients
(
mean
age
,
62.8
years
)
,
stratified
by
concomitant
use
of
selegiline
,
were
randomized
to
ropinirole
(
n
=
116
)
or
placebo
(
n
=
125
)

The
starting
dose
of
ropinirole
was
0.25
mg
tid
with
titration
to
at
least
1.5
mg
tid
(
maximum
dose
,
8
mg
tid
)

Primary
efficacy
endpoint
was
the
percentage
improvement
in
Unified
Parkinson
's
Disease
Rating
Scale
(
UPDRS
)
motor
score

Ropinirole-treated
patients
had
a
significantly
greater
percentage
improvement
in
UPDRS
motor
score
than
patients
who
received
placebo
(
+24
%
vs

;

)

Ropinirole
was
well
tolerated
and
patient
withdrawals
were
infrequent

Most
adverse
experiences
were
related
to
peripheral
dopaminergic
activity

Ropinirole
monotherapy
is
an
effective
and
well-tolerated
therapeutic
option
for
treatment
of
early
Parkinson

Starfish
oocytes
can
be
fertilized
after
germinal
vesicle
breakdown
(
GVBD
)
and
artificial
parthenogenesis
can
be
induced
by
activating
the
oocytes
after
GVBD
(
post-GVBD
activation
)

In
the
present
study
,
parthenogenotes
were
obtained
by
the
activation
of
immature
oocytes
with
caffeine
before
treatment
with
1-methyladenine
(
1-MeAde
)
to
induce
oocyte
maturation

Most
of
the
caffeine-treated
eggs
developed
as
tetraploids
,
as
parthenogenotes
produced
by
the
post-GVBD
activation

The
parthengenotes
were
derived
only
from
eggs
that
failed
to
extrude
polar
bodies
,
mostly
from
eggs
failing
to
extrude
a
second
polar
body

Eggs
derived
from
immature
oocytes
activated
by
A23187
,
treated
with
1-MeAde
and
post-treated
with
cytochalasin
B
failed
to
extrude
polar
bodies
,
and
eventually
developed
into
parthenogenetic
embryos

These
results
indicate
that
the
present
parthenogenesis
mechanism
shares
the
same
characteristics
as
that
achieved
by
post-GVBD
activation
in
the
suppression
of
polar
body
formation
as
a
key
means
for
successful
starfish
parthenogenesis

We

The

on

The

into
two

,
one
control
and
the
other
receiving
about
16
mg

in
their
drinking

After
6
months
of
fluoride
dosing
,
all
rabbits
were
euthanized
and
bone
and
blood
samples
were
taken
for
analyses

Fluoride

increased

levels
by
over
an

(

No

nor
did

However
,
the
increases
in

were
not

In
conclusion
,
fluoride
's
effects
on
bone

and
bone

were
not
mediated
by
PTH

IGF-1
was
increased
by

PURPOSE
:
To
determine
the
effect
of
various
methods
of
managing
the
posterior
capsule
and
anterior
vitreous
on
the
rate
of
posterior
capsule
opacification
in
pediatric
eyes
implanted
with
posterior
chamber
intraocular
lenses
(
PC
IOLs
)

SETTING
:
Cullen
Eye
Institute
,
Baylor
College
of
Medicine
,
Houston
,
Texas
,
USA

METHODS
:
We
reviewed
the
charts
of
20
eyes
of
15
children
(
aged
1.5
to
2
years
)
who
had
primary
cataract
surgery
with
PC
IOL
implantation
during
the
past
5
years

The
posterior
capsule
and
anterior
vitreous
were
managed
in
a
variety
of
ways
:
In
5
eyes
,
the
posterior
capsule
was
left
intact
;
in
15
eyes
,
a
posterior
continuous
curvilinear
capsulorhexis
(
PCCC
)
was
performed
-
6
with
and
9
without
anterior
vitrectomy
;
in
8
eyes
,
posterior
optic
capture
was
performed
-
3
with
and
5
without
vitrectomy

The
follow-up
ranged
from
1
to
4.5
years
(
mean
2
years
)

RESULTS
:
Visually
significant
secondary
cataract
developed
in
the
five
eyes
with
intact
posterior
capsules
and
in
the
four
eyes
that
had
PCCC
without
vitrectomy
and
without
posterior
optic
capture
(
i.e
.
,
the
optic
was
left
in
the
capsular
bag
)

The
optical
axis
remained
clear
in
the
six
eyes
that
had
PC
IOL
implantation
with
vitrectomy
(
with
or
without
posterior
optic
capture
)

Initially
,
all
eyes
that
had
optic
capture
without
vitrectomy
also
remained
clear
,
but
after
6
months
,
four
of
five
developed
opacification

CONCLUSION
:
In
this
series
,
PCCC
with
anterior
vitrectomy
was
the
only
effective
method
of
preventing
or
delaying
secondary
cataract
formation
in
infants
and
children

Evidence
for
the
presence
of
a
serotonin1A
(
5-HT1A
)
receptor
subtype
in
the
salmonid
fish
brain
has
recently
been
presented

In
the
present
study
the
potent
5-HT1A
receptor
agonist
,
8-hydroxy-2-
(
di-n-propylamino
)
-tetralin
(
8-OH-DPAT
)
was
tested
for
its
effect
on
plasma
cortisol
concentrations
in
rainbow
trout
(
Oncorhynchus
mykiss
)

Blood
was
sampled
and
8-OH-DPAT
administered
through
a
catheter
in
the
dorsal
aorta

Thirty
minutes
after
the
injection
of
40
microg
of
8-OH-DPAT/kg
,
plasma
cortisol
levels
had
increased
from
12
to
149
ng/ml
,
whereupon
they
fell
,
reaching
baseline
levels
after
4
h.
The
effect
of
1-40
microg
8-OH-DPAT/kg
on
plasma
cortisol
concentrations
was
dose-dependent

The
results
lends
further
support
to
the
hypothesis
that
the
brain
serotonergic
system
plays
a
key
role
in
integrating
autonomic
,
behavioral
and
neuroendocrine
stress-responses
in
fish
as
well
as
mammals
,
suggesting
that
not
only
the
structural
and
biochemical
organization
,
but
also
the
function
of
the
serotonergic
system
has
been
conserved
during
vertebrate
evolution

OBJECTIVE
:
To
assess
the
medicalising
effect
of
prescribing
antibiotics
for
sore
throat

SETTING
:
11
general
practices
in
England

DESIGN
:
Randomised
trial
of
three
approaches
to
sore
throat
:
a
10
day
prescription
of
antibiotics
,
no
antibiotics
,
or
a
delayed
prescription
if
the
sore
throat
had
not
started
to
settle
after
three
days

PATIENTS
:
716
patients
aged
4
and
over
with
sore
throat
and
an
abnormal
physical
sign
:
84
%
had
tonsillitis
or

OUTCOME
MEASURES
:
Number
and
rate
of
patients
making
a
first
return
with
sore
throat
,
pharyngitis
,
or
tonsillitis

Early
returns
(
within
two
weeks
)
and
complications
(
otitis

,
sinusitis
,

)

Outcomes
were
documented
in
675
subjects
(
94
%
)

RESULTS
:
Mean
follow
up

was
similar
(
antibiotic

,
other
two
groups

)

More
of
those
initially
prescribed
antibiotics

returned
to
the

)

Antibiotics
prescribed
for
sore
throat
during
the
previous
year
had
an
additional
effect
(
hazard
ratio
1.69
,
1.20
to
2.37
)

Longer
duration
of
illness
(
>
5
days
)
was
associated
with
increased
return
within
six
weeks
(
hazard
ratio
2.90
,
1.70
to
4.92
)

Prior
attendance
with
upper
respiratory
conditions
was
also
associated
with
increased
reattendance

There
was
no
difference
between
groups
in
early
return
(
13/238
(
5.5
%
)
v
27/437

)
,
or
complications
(
2/236
(
0.8

)
)

CONCLUSIONS
:
Complications
and
early
return
resulting
from
no
or
delayed
prescribing
of
antibiotics
for
sore
throat
are
rare

Both
current
and
previous
prescribing

sore
throat
increase
reattendance

To
avoid
medicalising
a
self
limiting
illness
doctors
should
avoid
antibiotics
or
offer
a
delayed
prescription
for
most
patients
with
sore
throat

relationship
and
on
biomedical
,
personal
and
contextual
perspectives
in
diagnosis

Most
evidence
available
to
general
practitioners
(
GPs
)
addresses
only
the
bio-medical
perspective
and
is
often
not
directly
applicable
to
primary
care
,
as
it
derives
from
secondary
or
tertiary
care

Emphasis
on
the
biomedical
domain
and
the
randomized
controlled
trial
(
RCT
)
alone
reflects
a
reductionist
approach
that
fails
to
do
justice
to
the
philosophy
of
general
practice

The
art
of
medicine
is
founded
on
context
,
anecdote
,
patient
stories
of
illness
and
personal
experience
,
and
we
should
continue
to
blend
this
with
good
quality
and
appropriate
research
findings
in
patient
care

Abdominal
tuberculosis
is
not
uncommon
in
the
UK
,
especially
in
Asian
immigrants

It
resembles
Crohn
's
disease
clinically
and
radiologically
,
and
it
may
be
difficult
to
differentiate
between
them
,
even
at
laparotomy
or
histology

The
distinction
is
important
,
however
,
for
proper
management
of
the
two
conditions

<
TO_SEE

Every
effort
must
be
made
to
exclude
abdominal
tuberculosis
before
the
patient
is
diagnosed
as
having
Crohn
's
disease
and
is
treated
with
steroids

PURPOSE
:
The
American
Urological
Association
convened
the
Female
Stress
Urinary
Incontinence
Clinical
Guidelines
Panel
to
analyze
the
literature
regarding
surgical
procedures
for
treating
stress
urinary
incontinence
in
the
otherwise
healthy
female
subject
and
to
make
practice
recommendations
based
on
the
treatment
outcomes
data

MATERIALS
AND
METHODS
:
The
panel
searched
the
MEDLINE
data
base
for
all
articles
through
1993
on
surgical
treatment
of
female
stress
urinary
incontinence

Outcomes
data
were
extracted
from
articles
accepted
after
panel
review

The
data
were
then
meta-analyzed
to
produce
outcome
estimates
for
alternative
surgical
procedures

RESULTS
:
The
data
indicate
that
after
48
months
retropubic
suspensions
and
slings
appear
to
be
more
efficacious
than
transvaginal
suspensions
,
and
also
more
efficacious
than
anterior
repairs

The
literature
suggests
higher
complication
rates
when
synthetic
materials
are
used
for
slings

CONCLUSIONS
:
The
panel
found
sufficient
acceptable
long-term
outcomes
data
(
longer
than
48
months
)
to
conclude
that
surgical
treatment
of
female
stress
urinary
incontinence
is
effective
,
offering
a
long-term
cure
in
a
significant
percentage
of
women

The
evidence
supports
surgery
as
initial
therapy
and
as
a
secondary
form
of
therapy
after
failure
of
other
treatments
for
stress
urinary
incontinence

Retropubic
suspensions
and
slings
are
the
most
efficacious
procedures
for
long-term
success
(
based
on
cure/dry
rates
)

However
,
in
the
panel
's
opinion
retropubic
suspensions
and
sling
procedures
are
associated
with
slightly
higher
complication
rates
,
including
longer
convalescence
and
postoperative
voiding
dysfunction

A
55-year-old
lady
underwent
repeat
aortic
valve
replacement
using
a
16-mm
Carbomedics
prosthesis

She
made
an
uneventful
postoperative
recovery
and
now
leads
an
unrestricted
life

Doppler
echocardiography
reveals
a
21-mm
Hg
gradient
across
the
valve
at
rest

This
did
not
increase
with
an
infusion
of
30
mcg/kg
per
min
of
dobutamine
,
which
resulted
in
an
increase
in
the
cardiac
output
from
1.96
to
5.46
l/min

BACKGROUND
:
For
more
than
30
years
it
has
been
known
that
gastric
acid
secretion
is
inversely
related
to
the
extent
and
severity
of
corpal
gastritis

We
therefore
evaluated
the
effect
of
cure
of
Helicobacter
pylori
infection
on
basal
and
pentagastrin-stimulated
acid
secretion

METHODS
:
Basal
acid
output
(
BAO
)
and
maximal
acid
output
(
MAO
)
were
assessed
in
11
H.
pylori-infected
dyspeptic
patients
(
8
women
and
3
men
;
mean
age
,
28
years
)
before
and
after
successful
anti-H

pylori
therapy

RESULTS
:
The
gastritis
index
was
significantly
lower
after
therapy
and
was
associated
with
an
increase
in
both
BAO
and
MAO
after
cure
of
the
H.
pylori
infection
(
BAO
from
0.3
mmol/h
and
MAO
from
4.8
mmol/h
to
19
mmol/
h
)

Basal
and
stimulated
acid
concentrations
also
increased
(
29.1
+/-
36.6
to
54
+/-
31
mmol/l
and
72.5
+/-
46
to
120.1
+/-
30
mmol/l
,
respectively
,
for
basal
and
stimulated
acid
concentrations
;
P
&
#
60
;
0.05
for
peak
and
MAO
,
P
=
0.07
for
BAO
)

CONCLUSION
:
Gastric
acid
secretion
increased
into
the
normal
range
after
successful
treatment
of
H.
pylori
infection
,
suggesting
that
gastric
function
can
recover
to
normal
or
almost
normal
after
cure
of
H.
pylori
infection

OBJECTIVE
:
Reports
suggest
that
there
is
an
increased
incidence
of
preeclampsia
after
a
previously
normal
pregnancy
if
there
is
a
change
in
paternity

We
hypothesize
that
there
is
a
higher
incidence
of
preeclampsia
(
proteinuric
hypertension
)
in
women
conceiving
by
intrauterine
insemination
with
donor
sperm
versus
intrauterine
insemination
with
partner
sperm

STUDY
DESIGN
:
This
was
a
retrospective
cohort
study

In
women
with
primary
infertility
all
pregnancies
achieved
by
either
partner
or
donor
intrauterine
insemination
carried
to
birth
of
a
fetus
(
>
20
weeks
)
were
identified

The
medical
records
were
examined
for
the
maternal
and
pregnancy
outcome
data

The
relative
risk
and
95
%
confidence
interval
were
calculated
for
the
risk
of
preeclampsia

The
baseline
data
were
compared
with
t
tests
,
chi
2
analysis
and
Fisher
's
exact
test
where
appropriate

RESULTS
:
Forty-four
patients
in
the
partner
intrauterine
insemination
group
and
37
in
the
donor
insemination
group
were
identified
as
having
primary
infertility

Three
cases
of
mild
preeclampsia
were
found
in
the
partner
insemination
program
and
nine
cases
of
preeclampsia
(
five
severe
,
four
mild
)
in
the
donor
insemination
program
(
relative
risk
1.85
,
95
%
confidence
interval
1.20
to
2.85
)
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
There
is
a
higher
incidence
of
preeclampsia
in
women
conceiving
by
intrauterine
insemination
with
washed
donor
sperm
compared
with
intrauterine
insemination
with
washed
partner
sperm
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
There
is
a
higher
incidence
of
preeclampsia
in
women
conceiving
by
intrauterine
insemination
with
washed
donor
sperm
compared
with
intrauterine
insemination
with
washed
partner
sperm
.

This
supports
,
indirectly
,
an
immunologic
basis
for
preeclampsia

The
antigenic
factor
would
appear
to
be
located
on
the
sperm
as
opposed
to
the
seminal
fluid
itself

After
a
rapid
examination
of
a
few
basic
concepts
concerning
cellular
aging
and
programmed
cell
death
,
the
aging
of
the
tissues
and
organs
,
the
authors
discuss
the
principal
theories
on
senescence

They
underline
that
it
is
necessary
to
agree
in
considering
the
various
genetic
and
epigenetic
,
endogenous
and
exogenous
mechanisms
that
lead
to
the
complex
aging
phenomenon
multiple
and
interrelated

In
particular
they
stress
the
hypothesis
that
senescence
can
be
due
to
a
sum
of
molecular
damages
caused
by
free
radicals
,
and
to
the
loss
of
telomeric
DNA

Radical
reactions
can
cause
mutations
,
inactivation
or
a
decrease
in
the
turnover
of
mitochondrial
DNA
which
is
more
vulnerable
than
the
nuclear
genoma
to
the
attack
of
mutagenic
agents
,
acting
also
as
a
continuous
source
of
initial
and/or
promoting
factors
of
the
carcinogenetic
process

The
somatic
cells
become
senescent
because
during
cell
division
,
they
lose
the
mechanisms
for
the
lengthening
of
the
telomere

The
telomerase
prevents
the
shortening
of
telomeres
in
neoplastic
cells
and
therefore
renders
them
immortal

Paradoxically
the
protection
of
the
telomere
is
exactly
what
must
be
avoided
in
the
case
of
tumor
cells

Recently
the
demonstration
that
telomerase
is
not
always
involved
in
the
restoration
of
telomere
length
shows
the
complexity
of
the
problems
connected
to
the
cause
of
senescence

Chromosomally
integrated
retroviral
switch
(
S
)
substrates
have
been
developed
to
reveal
switch
recombinase-like
activities
(
SRLA
)
in
pre-B
and
mature
B
cell
lines

Switch
substrate
retrovectors
(
SSR
)
contain
a
long-terminal
repeat-driven
neomycin
(
Neo
)
gene
for
proviral
chromosomal
maintenance
(
pre-
and
post-S
recombination
)
and
a
CMV
promoter-driven
,
chimeric
hygromycin-thymidine
kinase
(
Hytk
)
gene
(
flanked
by
S
mu
and
S
gamma
2b
recombination
targets
)
to
select
for
(
ganciclovir
)
and
against
(
hygromycin
B
)
S
region
recombination

The
retro-substrates
'
strong
,
constitutive
promoters
ensure
that
variations
in
cellular
switch
recombinase
activities
are
independent
of
S
region
accessibility
control

By
initially
selecting
for
proviral
integrants
in
hygromycin
followed
by
shifting
into
neomycin
+
ganciclovir
to
select
for
S
sequence-mediated
deletions
,
switch
recombinations
can
be
specifically
forestalled
in
B
cell
lines
whilst
most
switch-incompetent
cells
do
not
survive
secondary
selection

A
qualitative
,
direct
PCR
assay
reveals
that
SSR
recombinations
are
stochastic
in
B
cell
lines
generating
a
product
array
akin
to
natural
GH
class
switching

A
semi-quantitative
DC-PCR
assay
detects
a
significant
recombinase
activity
only
in
a
restricted
set
of
late
stage
pre-B
and
mature
B
cell
lines

BCL1B1
mature
B
cells
have
the
highest
level
of
recombinase
activity
with
25
%
or
more
of
proviral
integrants
accumulating
S
mu/S
gamma
2b
substrate
recombinations
within
10-14
cell
generations

The
SSR
recombinase
assay
can
be
performed
in
a
transient
fashion
wherein
extensive
,
B
cell-specific
recombination
can
be
visualized
within
only
a
few
cell
divisions
post
proviral
integration

We
propose
that
switch
recombinase
activity
becomes
activated
during
B
cell
ontogeny
independent
of
or
prior
to
the
acquisition
of
CH
locus
accessibility
and
that
endogenous
S
segment
targeting
to
pre-existing
recombinase
requires
a
level
of
accessibility
beyond
transcriptional
activation

OBJECTIVE
:
To
determine
the
prevalence
of
illicit
drug
abuse
and
alcohol
use
in
an
obstetric
population
based
in
an
urban
maternity
hospital

SETTING
:
A

study
between
the
Rotunda
Hospital
,
Dublin
and
the
Irish
National

Centre

DESIGN
:
A
prospective
study
consisting
of
anonymous
,
unlinked
urine
testing
of
504
'first
visit
'
antenatal
patients
and
a
separate
group
of
515
patients
six
weeks
after
delivery

METHODS
&
#

;
OUTCOME
MEASURES
:
Toxicological
screening
using
enzyme-linked
immunoassay
techniques
,
with
all
positive
samples
being
reanalysed

Drug
histories
were
taken
and
samples
were
tested
for
alcohol
and
six
of
the
most
commonly
abused
drugs

The
pre-
and
postnatal
prevalence
of
abuse
was
matched
with
demographic
data

RESULTS
:
The
prevalence
of
chemical
substance
misuse
in
the
antenatal
population
was
2.8
%
and
5.6
%
in
the
postnatal
population

Substances
identified
included
benzodiazepines
,
cannabis
,
amphetamines
,
opiates
and
cocaine

Less
than
2
%
of
samples
tested
positive
for
alcohol

None
of
the
women
yielding
positive
samples
had
been
pre-identified
on
the
basis
of
history

A
significant
proportion
of
the
women
were
in
the
high
risk
categories
with
regard
to
age
and
socio-economic
status

CONCLUSION
:
The
prevalence
of
drug
misuse
antenatally
was
nearly
3
%
and
postnatally
almost
6
%

Substance
abusers
in
pregnancy
are
more
likely
to
be
single
,
unemployed
,
and
to
have
had
a
previous
pregnancy

Schizophrenic
illnesses
occur
with
approximately
the
same
incidence
in
all
human
populations
with
a
characteristic
distribution
(
slightly
earlier
in
males
)
of
ages
of
onset

Given
that
the
predisposition
(
which
presumably
is
genetic
)
is
associated
with
a
procreative
disadvantage
why
do
such
illnesses
persist
?
Here
it
is
suggested
that
these
conditions
are
a
manifestation
of
genetic
diversity
in
the
evolution
of
the
specifically
human
characteristic
of
language
,
an
innovation
that
has
occurred
by
a
process
of
progressive
hemispheric
specialization-the
establishment
of
dominance
for
some
critical
component
of
language
in
one
or
the
other
hemisphere

Individuals
who
develop
schizophrenic
symptoms
show
lesser
anatomical
and
functional
asymmetries
than
the
population
as
a
whole
;
such
symptoms
may
reflect
'dominance
failure
'
for
language

Cloacal
anomalies
are
extremely
rare
and
have
variable
presentations

Prenatal
diagnosis
can
be

especially
if
they

Here
we
present
two
cases
diagnosed
in
the
late
third

and
review
the
literature
regarding
prenatal

of
cloacal
anomalies

OBJECTIVE
:
To
determine
whether
patients
with
myocardial
amyloidosis
due
either
to
AL
(
primary
)
amyloid
or
familial
amyloid
have
distinguishing
echocardiographic
or

features
;
and
to
compare
the
prevalence
of
heart
failure
and
survival
in
the
two
types
of
amyloidosis
in
relation
to
echocardiographic
findings

DESIGN
:
Blinded
group
comparison
of
randomly
selected
cases
of

amyloidosis

SETTING
:
International

PATIENTS
:
36
patients
with
cardiac
amyloid
heart
disease
,
of
whom
12
had
familial
and
24
had
primary
AL
amyloidosis

RESULTS
:
Familial
and
AL
echocardiograms
were
morphologically
indistinguishable
,
with
similar
left
ventricular
wall
thickness
,
mean
(
SD
)
15.4
(
2.3
)
nu
15.8
(

,
respectively
;
right
ventricular

was
also
similar
between
amyloid
types
:
9.6
(

9.7
(

,
respectively

Doppler
indices
of
left
and
right
ventricular
function
,
left

volume
,
and
ejection
fraction
were
also
similar

Low
voltage
electrocardiograms
(

;
0.5
mV
)
were
more
common
in
the
AL
(
16/24
,
67

)
than
in
the
familial
group
(
4/12

%
)
,
P
&

The
one

survival
for

forms
was
92

)
nu
38
%
(
6/24
)
,
respectively
,
with
virtually
all
deaths
due
to
cardiac
causes

CONCLUSIONS
:
Although
cardiac
involvement
is
echocardiographically
indistinguishable
,
cardiac
mortality
is
very
different
between
the
two
forms
of
amyloidosis

Preservation
of
electrocardiographic
voltage
in
familial
amyloidosis
suggests
that
the
particular
biochemical
characteristics
of
distinct
types
of
amyloid
fibril
have
different
pathological
effects
on
the
myocardium

This
distinction
becomes
critical
in
the
evaluation
,
treatment
,
and
management
of
patients
who
have
a
diagnosis
within
the
spectrum
of
the
protein

RESEARCH
DESIGN
AND
METHODS
:
We
studied
171
Pima
Indians
with
type
2
diabetes
between
the
ages
of
30-70
years
in
a
population-based

survey

Plasma

measured
by
a
spectrophotometric
assay
and
PAI-1
4G/5G
promoter
genotype
by
the
polymerase

reaction
(
PCR
)
using

Retinopathy
was
assessed
by
ophthalmoscopy
after
pupillary
dilation
and
classified
as
any
retinopathy
or
as
nonproliferative
and
proliferative

RESULTS
:
Retinopathy
was
present
in
70
(
41
%
)
subjects
,
and
4
(
2.3
%
)
subjects
had
proliferative
retinopathy

Plasma
PAI-1
activity
was
not
significantly
different
among
subjects
with
and
without
retinopathy
(

PAI-1

was
negatively

with

(

In
a

controlled
for

any

and
remained

after
controlling
for

,
BMI
,
duration
of

,
glycated

albumin-to-creatine
ratio
in
a

analysis

The
odds
ratios
for
retinopathy
in
subjects
with
4G/4G
and
4G/5G
,
compared
with
the
5G/5G
genotype
,
were
2.0
and
3.1
,
respectively

CONCLUSIONS
:
Although
diabetic
retinopathy
in
Pima
Indians
with
type
2
diabetes
is
not
associated
with
PAI-1
activity
,
subjects
with
the
4G/4G
and
4G/5G
genotype
had
a
higher
prevalence
of
retinopathy
compared
with
5G/5G
PAI-1genotype

These
preliminary
findings
indicate
that
in
Pima
Indians
with
type
2
diabetes
,
presence
of
the
4G
allele
of
the
PAI-1
gene
was
associated
with
a
higher
risk
of
diabetic
retinopathy

BACKGROUND
:
Diagnostic
peritoneal
lavage
(
DPL
)
is
used
to
diagnose
intra-abdominal
injury
in
patients
with
stab
wounds
and
blunt
trauma

Because
exploratory
celiotomy
is
routinely
performed
on
patients
with
gunshot
wounds
to
the
abdomen
,
DPL
is
rarely
employed

However
,
several
studies
have
questioned
routine
exploration
and
have
drawn
attention
to
the
associated
morbidity
of
negative
celiotomy

Diagnostic
peritoneal
lavage
is
an
easily
performed
and
inexpensive
test
that
may
be
useful
in
this
situation

OBJECTIVE
:
To
evaluate
the
performance
of
DPL
in
the
diagnosis
of
intra-abdominal
injury
in
hemodynamically
stable
patients
with
gunshot
wounds
to
the
abdomen

DESIGN
:
A
prospective
clinical
trial

SETTING
:
Two
urban
trauma
centers

PATIENTS
:
Patients
with
gunshot
wounds
to
the
abdomen
and
a
systolic
blood
pressure
of
at
least
90
mm
Hg

INTERVENTIONS
:
Clinical
predication
of
intra-abdominal
injury
in
the
emergency
department
and
DPL
performed
in
the
operating
room
before
the
initiation
of
celiotomy

Injuries
found
during
the
celiotomy
were
recorded

MAIN
OUTCOME
MEASURES
:
The
results
of
the
clinical
evaluation
and
DPL
were
compared
with
the
findings
of
the
celiotomy

RESULTS
:
Forty-four
patients
were
enrolled
into
the
study

Intra-abdominal
injury
was
present
in
32
(
73
%
)
of
these
patients

The
senior
surgery
resident
correctly
predicted
the
presence
of
intra-abdominal
injury
in
36
(

of
the
patients

correctly
identified
the

CONCLUSIONS
:
Clinical
judgment
is
highly
accurate
in
separating
patients
with
tangential
gunshot
wounds
to
the
abdomen
from
those
with
intra-abdominal
injury
but
may
miss
patients
with
intra-abdominal
hemorrhage

Diagnostic
peritoneal
lavage
is
highly
predictive
of
the
presence
of
intra-abdominal
injury

The
return
of
gross
blood
on
aspiration
or
a
lavage
red
blood
cell
count
greater
than
10
x
10
(
9
)
/L
should
prompt
an
urgent
celiotomy

Missed
injuries
are
rare
and
most
likely
to
be
bowel
perforations

Diagnostic
peritoneal
lavage
is
an
objective
test
that
may
augment
clinical
judgment
in
selecting
hemodynamically
stable
patients
with
potential
tangential
gunshot
wounds
for
observation
and
is
especially
useful
in
identifying
intra-abdominal
hemorrhage

BACKGROUND
:
To
evaluate
the
frequency
of
Blastocystis
hominis
parasitation
and
to
ascertain
its
role
as
an
intestinal
a
prospective
study
during
18
months
pathogen
has
been
carried
out

SUBJECTS
AND
METHODS
:
The
study
included
2
,
039
patients
,
which
were
classified
in
three
groups
(
asymptomatic
(
group
A
)
,
with
suspicion
of
parasitosis
(
group
B
)
,
with
diarrhoea
(
group
C
)
)

In
all
cases
a
coproparasitological
study
was
performed

In
the
group
C
the
presence
of
non-parasitic
enteropathogens
was
also
investigated

In
patients
with
B

hominis
in
the
absence
of
other
pathogens
clinical
and
epidemiological
characteristics
were
evaluated

Also
,
its
was
determined
the
morphology
and
quantification
of
parasites

RESULTS
:
Parasites
were
identified
in
26.2
%
of
population

B

hominis
was
identified
in
336
patients
(
16.5
%
)

The
frequency
of
parasitation
was
superior
in
adults
(
p
&
#
60
;
0.0001
)
,
with
a
slight
predominance
in
the
female
sex

The
rate
of
asymptomatic
carriers
was
3.3
%

In
21
patients
B

hominis
(
group
C
)
was
observed
in
absence
of
other
enteropathogens

Statistical
significant
association
was
found
between
B

hominis
,
in
absence
of
other
pathogens
and
the
presence
of
clinical
manifestations
(
p
&
#
60
;
0.0001
)
,
the
most
common
of
which
were
diarrhoea
and
abdominal
pain

We
did
not
find
a
statistically
significant
association
between
the
number
of
B

hominis
present
and
stool
characteristics

The
vacuolar
form
was
the
predominant
morphological
type

The
ameboid
form
was
observed
only
in
diarrhoeal
stools

CONCLUSIONS
:
B

hominis
is
the
most
frequent
parasite
found
in
faecal
parasitological
investigation

In
absence
of
other
causes
,
B

hominis
must
be
considered
as
a
pathogen

BACKGROUND
:
The
cause
of
severe
acquired
hyperammonemia
,
an
uncommon
but
often
fatal
complication
of
organ
transplantation
and
chemotherapy
for
cancer
,
is
obscure

<
/TO_SEES
>
OBJECTIVE
:
To
test
the
hypothesis
that
liver
glutamine
synthetase
deficiency
may
explain
hyperammonemia
in
patients
who
have
had
organ
transplantation
or
are
receiving
chemotherapy

DESIGN
:
Case
report

PATIENTS
:
Two
patients
who
had
fatal
hyperammonemia
after
orthotopic
lung
transplantation
.

MEASUREMENTS
:
Liver
tissue
was
analyzed
to
determine
the
activities
of
two
urea
cycle
enzymes
and
glutamine
synthetase

Western
blot
assays
for
hepatic
glutamine
synthetase
were
performed
to
determine
whether
glutamine
synthetase
deficiency
resulted
from
reduced
enzyme
levels

RESULTS
:
Activities
of
carbamoyl
phosphate
synthetase
I
and
ornithine
carbamoyltransferase
in
the
liver
were
normal

The
activity
of
hepatic
glutamine
synthetase
was
markedly
reduced
(
in
patient
1
,
12
%
of
the
mean
value
in
controls
;
in
patient
2
,
28
%
of
the
mean
value
in
controls
)
,
and
a
concomitant
reduction
in
the
amount
of
glutamine
synthetase
protein
was
observed

<
TO_SEE
>
CONCLUSION
:
Hyperammonemia
after
transplantation
was
associated
with
hepatic
glutamine
synthetase
deficiency
in
two
patients
,
but
the
causal
relation
between
these
two
conditions
must
be
further
studied

Postnatal
growth
was
prospectively
measured
from
birth
to
1
y
in
54
term
infants
born
small
for
gestational
age
(
SGA
)
,
fed
either
breast
milk
or
a
standard
term
infant
formula

Breastfeeding
was
associated
with
a
0.36
and
0.64
standard
deviation
(
SD
)
increase
in
weight
at
2
weeks
and
3
months
of
age
,
respectively
,
which
persisted
beyond
the
breastfeeding
period
(
0.64
SD
at
1
y
)

Breastfed
infants
also
showed
greater
catch-up
growth
in
head
circumference
(
SD
score
(
SDS
)
0.53
higher
at
3
months
)
,
and
greater
body
length
gain
(
SDS
0.68
higher
at
6
months
)

This
increased
growth
was
independent
of
potentially
confounding
obstetric
,
social
and
demographic
factors

Our
findings
suggest
that
breastfeeding
may
promote
faster
growth
in
infants
compromised
by
poor
growth
in
utero

SGA
infants
may
be
programmed
for
a
number
of
adverse
outcomes
;
the
possibility
that
such
events
are
altered
by
choice
of
postnatal
diet
is
a
key
issue
for
future
research

BACKGROUND
:
Few
studies
have
explored
the
health
practices
of
critical
care
nurses

Critical
care
nurses
routinely
teach
patients
about
using
healthy
practices
such
as
low-fat
diets
,
exercise
,
and
routine
screening
examinations

However
,
it
may
be
even
more
important
that
the
nurses
themselves
have
a
healthy
lifestyle
,
thus
serving
as
role
models
for
patients

Nurses
are
selling
a
product
,
and
that
product
is
health

The
best
salespersons
are
those
who
are
genuinely
committed
to
their
product
and
model
its
benefits

Therefore
,
critical
care
nurses
'
healthful
practices
can
have
a
profound
effect
on
their
patients

OBJECTIVES
:
The
purpose
of
this
descriptive
exploratory
study
was
to
examine
critical
care
nurses
'
responses
to
three
questions
about
health
practices
in
their
daily
lives
:
(
1
)
What
are
critical
care
nurses
doing
currently
to
stay
healthy
?
(
2
)
Do
they
anticipate
making
any
changes
in
their
lifestyle
in
the
future
?
(
3
)
Would
they
recommend
their
lifestyle
to
their
patients
?
METHODS
:
One
hundred
twenty-seven
critical
care
nurses
attending
a
midwestern
critical
care
conference
completed
a
two-part
questionnaire
designed
to
produce
a
health
profile

In
a
man-on-the-street
approach
,
23
nurses
participated
in
an
interview
via
video
camera

Descriptive
statistics
were
used
to
analyze
the
data
retrieved
from
the
questionnaires

Interviews
were
transcribed
verbatim
and
analyzed
for
themes
with
a
constant
comparative
method

RESULTS
:
More
than
70
%
of
the
critical
care
nurses
who
responded
engage
in
exercise
and
follow
a
healthy
,
low-fat
diet

Seventy-one
percent
said
that
they
anticipate
making
a
change
in
their
lifestyle
in
the
future
,
and
70
%
said
that
they
would
recommend
their
lifestyle
to
their
patients

Five
themes
emerged
from
the
videotaped
interviews
:
(
1
)
Heart-healthy
practices
predominated
the
responses

(
2
)
Incorporating
a
healthy
lifestyle
was
easy
for
some
and
a
struggle
for
others

(
3
)
Critical
care
nurses
readily
listed
barriers
to
healthy
living

(
4
)
The
nurses
had
a
positive
attitude
about
their
healthy
lifestyles
and
felt
optimistic
about
being
role
models
for
their
patients

(
5
)
Future
plans
were
either
singular
in
focus
or
limited
to
maintenance
of
current
health
habits

CONCLUSIONS
:
The
majority
of
the
nurses
reported
practicing
a
healthy
lifestyle
and
thought
that
they
were
good
role
models
for
patients

Cytochrome
P450
1A1
(
CYP1A1
)
and
glutathione
S-transferase
M1
(
GSTM1
)
genetic
polymorphisms
are
involved
in
the
activation
and
detoxification
of
chemical
carcinogens
found
in
tobacco
smoke
;
thus
they
may
influence
host
susceptibility
to
lung
cancer

In
this
study
at
Massachusetts
General
Hospital
(
Boston
,
MA
,
USA
)
of
416
cases
and
446
controls
(
mostly
White
)
we
evaluated
the
association
between
the
CYP1A1
MspI
and
GSTM1
polymorphisms
and
lung
cancer
risk
,
and
their
interaction
with
cigarette
smoke

The
CYP1A1
MspI
heterozygous
genotype
was
present
in
18
percent
of
cases
and
16
percent
of
controls
,
and
one
percent
of
cases
and
controls
were
CYP1A1
MspI
homozygous
variant

The
GSTM1
null
genotype
was
detected
in
54
percent
of
cases
and
52
percent
of
controls

After
adjusting
for
age
,
gender
,
pack-years
of
smoking
,
and
years
since
quitting
smoking
,
while
neither
the
CYP1A1
MspI
heterozygous
genotype
alone
nor
the
GSTM1
null
genotype
alone
were
associated
with
a
significant
increase
in
lung
cancer
risk
,
having
both
genetic
traits
was
associated
with
a
twofold
increase
in
risk
(
95
percent
confidence
interval
(
CI
)
=
1.0-3.4
)

Our
data
did
not
provide
enough
evidence
for
a
substantial
modification
of
the
effect
of
pack-years
on
lung
cancer
risk
by
the
CYP1A1
MspI
and
GSTM1
genotypes

However
,
limitations
of
our
study
preclude
a
conclusion
about
this
potential
interaction

BACKGROUND
:
Thrombolytic
treatment
has
been
shown
to
accelerate
resolution
of
major
pulmonary
embolism
and
lead
to
a
rapid
improvement
of
right-side
hemodynamics

However
,
the
association
between
these
favorable
effects
and
the
clinical
outcome
of
patients
who
have
no
severe
hemodynamic
compromise
at
presentation
remains
unknown

METHODS
AND
RESULTS
:
The
present
multicenter
registry
included
719
consecutive
patients
with
major
pulmonary
embolism
according
to
clinical
,
echocardiographic
,
scintigraphic
,
and
cardiac
catheterization
criteria

Symptom
onset
was
acute
(
&
#
60
;
48
hours
)
in
63
%
of
patients

All
patients
were
hemodynamically
stable
(
ie
,
without
evidence
of
cardiogenic
shock
)
at
presentation

treatment
(
within
24
hours
of
diagnosis
)
was
given
to
169
patients
(
23.5
%
)
,
whereas
the
remaining
550
patients
were
initially
treated
with
heparin
alone

Overall
30-day
mortality
was
significantly
lower
in
the
patients
who
received
thrombolytic
agents
(
4.7
versus
11.1
%
,
P=.016
)

Clinical
factors
associated
with
a
higher
death
rate
were
syncope
(
P=.012
)
,
arterial
hypotension
(
P=.021
)
,
history
of
congestive
heart
failure
(
P=.013
)
,
and
chronic
pulmonary
disease
(
P=.032
)

However
,
only
primary
thrombolysis
was
found
by
multivariate
analysis
to
be
an
independent
predictor
of
survival
(

Patients
who
underwent
early
thrombolytic
treatment
had
a
reduced
rate
of
recurrent
pulmonary
embolism
(
7.7
versus
18.7
%
,

but
also
a

episodes
(

,
P

Cerebral
bleeding
occurred
in
2
patients
in
each
treatment
group
,
and
1
patient
in
each
group
died
of
a
bleeding
complication

CONCLUSIONS
:
The
results
of
our
study
suggest
that
thrombolysis
may
favorably
affect
the
clinical
outcome
of
hemodynamically
stable
patients
with
major
pulmonary
embolism

A
66-year-old
male
engineer
diagnosed
with
malignant
pleural
mesothelioma
4
years
previously
had
thoracotomy
,
radiotherapy
,
and
chemotherapy

He
was
followed
regularly
with
chest
computed
tomography
(
CT
)
scan
and
had
been
asymptomatic

During
one
of
his
physical
examinations
,
routine
sigmoidoscopy
showed
incidental
colonic
polyps
which
were
biopsied

Subsequently
,
recurrence
of
pleural
mesothelioma
and
peritoneal
involvement
by
mesothelioma
was
documented

Two
of
the
polyps
showed
metastatic
malignant
mesothelioma
in
the
lamina
propia
which
strongly
resembled
adenocarcinoma
histologically
causing
difficulty
in
making
definitive
diagnosis

Review
of
the
literature
disclosed
no
previously
documented
similar
occurrence

This
case
shows
the
importance
of
clinical
history
and
ancillary
laboratory
procedures
such
as
immunohistochemistry
and
electron
microscopy
to
avoid
diagnostic
pitfalls

The
authors
report
the
postoperative
magnetic
resonance
(
MR
)
imaging
findings
in
36
patients
with
advanced
Parkinson
's
disease
who
underwent
unilateral
microelectrode-guided
posteroventral
pallidotomy

The
lesions
were
placed
within
1
mm
of
the
ventral
border
of
the
globus
pallidus
internus
(
GPi
)
to
include
pallidothalamic
outflow
pathways

Sequential
MR
studies
were
obtained
within
1
to
3
days
postoperatively
and
at
6-month
follow-up
examination

Thirty-four
(
94
%
)
of
the
36
patients
enjoyed
sustained
moderate
or
marked
improvement
of
their
parkinsonian
symptoms
6
months
postoperatively

Transient
side
effects
occurred
in
five
patients
(
14
%
)
,
but
there
were
no
persistent
complications

The
pallidal
radiofrequency
lesions
were
prolate
spheroid
shaped
and
were
composed
of
three
concentric
zones
in
the
early
postoperative
studies

The
mean
volume
of
the
middle
zone
,
corresponding
to
the
area
of
hemorrhagic
coagulation
necrosis
,
was
44.4
+/-
17.6
mm3
;
the
mean
lesion
volume
as
defined
by
the
outer
zone
,
corresponding
to
perilesional
edema
,
was
262.2
+/-
111.6
mm3

Additional
edema
spreading
to
the
internal
capsule
was
noted
in
32
of
34
cases
and
to
the
optic
tract
in
11
of
34
cases

In
two
patients
small
ischemic
infarctions
involving
the
corona
radiata
were

in
one
a
venous
infarction
was
detected

Ischemic
infarction
resulted
in
mild
transient
Broca
's
aphasia
in
one
patient
,
but
there
was
no
detectable
neurological
deficit
in
the
other
two

The
mean
volume
of
late-phase
(
6
months
)
lesions
was
22
+/-
28.8
mm3

In
three
patients
no
lesion
was
identified
despite
sustained
clinical
improvement

The
lesion
was
located
in
the
posteroventral
GPi
in
all
cases
except
in
one
patient
in
whom
it
was
confined
to
the
GP
externus
(
GPe
)

This
49-year-old
woman
did
not
experience
sustained
benefit

The
authors
found
no
consistent
correlations
between
lesion
size
and
location
and
clinical
outcome
as
measured
by
a

Lesioning
of
pallidal
and
subpallidal
pathways
may
contribute
to
the
sustained
clinical
benefit
in
this

Magnetic
resonance
imaging

showed
that
intraoperative
microelectrode
recording
facilitated
accurate
placement
of
the

in
this
critical

A
commercially
available
health
food
product
of
cold-pressed
hemp
seed
oil
ingested
by
one
volunteer
twice
a
day
for
4
1/2
days
(
135
mL
total
)

Urine
specimens
collected
from
the
volunteer
were
subjected
to
standard
workplace
urine
drug
testing
procedures
,
and
the
following
concentrations
of
11-nor-delta9-
tetrahydrocannabinol
carboxylic
acid
(
9-THCA
)
were
detected
:
41
ng/mL
9-THCA
at
45
h
,
49
ng/mL
at
69
h
,
and
55
ng/mL
at
93
h.
Ingestion
was
discontinued
after
93
h
,
and
the
following
concentrations
were
detected
:
68
ng/mL
at
108
h
,
57
ng/mL
at
117
h
,
31
ng/mL
at
126
h
,
and
20
ng/mL
at
142
h.
The
first
specimen
that
tested
negative
(
50
ng/mL
initial
immunoassay

,
15
ng/mL
confirmatory
gas

)
was
at
146
h
,
which
was
53
h
after
the
last
hemp
seed
oil
ingestion

Four
subsequent
specimens
taken
to
177
h
were
also
negative

This
study
indicates
that
a
workplace
urine
drug
test
positive
for
cannabinoids
may
arise
from
the
consumption
of
commercially
available
cold-pressed
hemp
seed

OBJECTIVE
:
We
determined
the
sensitivity
and
specificity
of
neonatal
brain-stem
auditory
evoked
potentials
(
BAEP
)
as
markers
for
subsequent
hearing
impairment
and
for
developmental
problems
found
later
in
infancy
and
childhood

METHODS
:
BAEP
studies
were
performed
before
discharge
in
infants
treated
with
extracorporeal
membrane
oxygenation
(
ECMO
)
,
and
two
specific
abnormalities
were
analyzed
:
elevated
threshold
and
delayed
central
auditory
conduction

Behavioral
audiometry
was
repeated
during
periodic
follow-up
until
reliable
responses
were
obtained
for
all
frequencies
,
and
standardized
developmental
testing
was
also
conducted

The
sensitivity
and
specificity
of
an
elevated
threshold
on
the
neonatal
BAEP
for
detecting
subsequent
hearing
loss
,
and
the
relationship
of
any
neonatal
BAEP
abnormality
to
language
or
developmental
disorders
in
infancy
,
were
calculated

RESULTS
:
Test
results
for
46
ECMO-treated
infants
(
57.5
%
)
were
normal
,
and
those
for
34
infants
(
42.5
%
)
were
abnormal
,
with
either
elevated
wave
V
threshold
,
prolonged
wave
I-V
interval
,
or
both
on
neonatal
BAEP
recordings

Most
significantly
,
7
(
58
%
)
of
the
12
children
with
subsequent
sensorineural
hearing
loss
had
left
the
hospital
after
showing
normal
results
on
threshold
tests

There
was
no
significant
difference
in
the
frequency
of
hearing
loss
between
subjects
with
abnormal
(
5/21
,
or
24
%
)
and
those
with
normal
BAEP
thresholds
(
7/59
,
or
12
%
;
Fisher
Exact
Test
,
p
=
0.28
)

Therefore
the
sensitivity
of
neonatal
BAEP
testing
for
predicting
subsequent
hearing
loss
was
only
42
%

Neonatal
BAEP
specificity
for
excluding
subsequent
hearing
loss
was
76
%

In
contrast
,
on
language
development
testing
,
19
children
demonstrated
receptive
language
delay

Of
these
children
,
12
(
63
%
)
had
abnormal
neonatal
BAEP
recordings
and
7
(
37
%
)
had
a
normal
BAEP
threshold
,
normal
central
auditory
conduction
test
results
,
or
both
(
p
=
0.04
)

CONCLUSIONS
:
Neonatal
BAEP
threshold
recordings
were
of
limited
value
for
predicting
subsequent
hearing
loss
common
in
ECMO
-treated
survivors

However
,
an
abnormal
neonatal
BAEP
significantly
increased
the
probability
of
finding
a
receptive
language
delay
during
early
childhood
,
even
in
those
with
subsequently
normal
audiometry
findings

Because
neonatal
ECMO
is
associated
with
a
high
risk
of
hearing
and
receptive
language
disorders
,
parents
should
be
counseled
that
audiologic
and
developmental
follow-up
evaluations
in
surviving
children
are
essential
regardless
of
the
results
of
neonatal
BAEP
testing

The
Federated
Council
of
Internal
Medicine
has
developed
a
resource
guide
to
help
internal
medicine
residency
programs
produce
internists
who
are
prepared
for
today
's
practice
of
internal
medicine
and
the
challenges
of
practice
in
the
future

The
guide
situates
general
internal
medicine
as
the
primary
care
profession
that
focuses
on
preventive
,
short-term
,
and
long-term
care
of
adult
patients

It
assumes
that
a
single
pathway
is
sufficient
for
educating
general
internists
and
subspecialty-bound
trainees

It
identifies
the
learning
experiences
that
should
be
part
of
general
internal
medicine
residency
training
,
lists
the
clinical
competencies
that
are
important
for
primary
care
practice
,
and
describes
the
role
of
the
integrative
disciplines
that
should
inform
the
care
of
every
patient

It
also
describes
a
process
that
program
directors
and
local
program
committees
can
use
to
develop
competency-based
curricula

BACKGROUND
:
Darier
disease
is
an
uncommon
genodermatosis
characterized
by
the
symmetrical
eruption
of
keratotic
reddish-brown
papules
occurring
in
the
seborrheic
areas
of
the
body

A
unilateral
,
or
localized
,
variant
has
been
identified

We
report
4
new
cases
of
localized
Darier
disease
and
review
the
English-language
literature

The
implications
of
these
cases
on
future
genetic
studies
are
also
discussed

OBSERVATIONS
:
Localized
Darier
disease
occurred
with
equal
frequency
in
males
and
females

The
average
age
at
onset
was
27
years

The
most
frequent
site
of
involvement
was
the
trunk
(
40
%
(
16/40
)
)

This
condition
was
aggravated
by
sunlight
,
heat
,
or
sweating
in
42
%
(
19/40
)
of
reported
cases
,
and
38
%
(
15/40
)
of
the
patients
responded
to
treatment
with
topical
tretinoin

CONCLUSIONS
:
Many
of
the
clinical
features
of
localized
Darier
disease
suggest
that
it
is
a
genetic
mosaic
of
generalized
Darier
disease

Further
studies
of
localized
Darier
disease
may
therefore
prove
to
be
instrumental
in
the
search
for
the
Darier
disease
gene

UV
radiation
induces
two
major
DNA
damage
products
,
the
cyclobutane
pyrimidine
dimer
(
CPD
)
and
,
at
a
lower
frequency
,
the
pyrimidine
(
6-4
)
pyrimidinone
dimer
(
6-4
product
)

Although
Escherichia
coli
and
Saccharomyes
cerevisiae
produce
a
CPD-specific
photolyase
that
eliminates
only
this
class
of
dimer
,
Arabidopsis
thaliana
,
Drosphila
melanogaster
,
Crotalus
atrox
,
and
Xenopus
laevis
have
recently
been
shown
to
photoreactivate
both
CPDs
and
6-4
products

We
describe
the
isolation
and
characterization
of
two
new
classes
of
mutants
of
Arabidopsis
,
termed
uvr2
and
uvr3
,
that
are
defective
in
the
photoreactivation
of
CPDs
and
6-4
products
,
respectively

We
demonstrate
that
the
CPD
photolyase
mutation
is
genetically
linked
to
a
DNA
sequence
encoding
a
type
II
(
metazoan
)
CPD
photolyase

In
addition
,
we
are
able
to
generate
plants
in
which
only
CPDs
or
6-4
products
are
photoreactivated
in
the
nuclear
genome
by
exposing
these
mutants
to
UV
light
and
then
allowing
them
to
repair
one
or
the
other
class
of
dimers

This
provides
us
with
a
unique
opportunity
to
study
the
biological
consequences
of
each
of
these
two
major
UV-induced
photoproducts
in
an
intact
living
system

A
diffuse
macular
erythroderma
and
subsequent
desquamation
after
1
to
2
weeks
are
two
of
the
five
major
diagnostic
criteria
of
toxic
shock
syndrome
(
TSS
)

We
present
the
case
of
a
15-month-old
girl
with
TSS
,
but
without
erythroderma
or
desquamation

She
was
admitted
with
high
fever
,
shock
,
and
multiorgan
involvement

Minimal
or
no
cutaneous
signs
were
present

Initially
the
diagnosis
of
the
syndrome
of
hemorrhagic
shock
and
encephalopathy
was
made

After
7
days
,
a
TSS
toxin
1-producing
strain
of
Staphylococcus
aureus
was
cultured
from
an
inguinal
lymph
node
,
where
inflammation
had
already
been
noticed
on
admission

Moreover
,
the
girl
had
no
antibodies
against
this
toxin

The
serum
cytokine
profile
during
the
acute
phase
of
her
illness
showed
high
levels
of
tumor
necrosis
factor-alpha
,
interleukin-6
and
interferon-gamma
,
as
is
seen
during
activation
of
the
immune
system
by
TSS
toxin
1

Other
possible
causes
for
the
patient
's
illness
were
excluded

We
conclude
that
the
patient
had
TSS
without
rash

Without
the
evidence
implicating
a
TSS
toxin
1-producing
strain
of
S.
aureus
as
the
cause
of
her
disease
,
a
diagnosis
of
syndrome
of
hemorrhagic
shock
and
encephalopathy
would
have
been
made

It
is
possible
that
some
cases
of
syndrome
of
hemorrhagic
shock
and
encephalopathy
represent
a
variant
of
TSS
in
small
children

BACKGROUND
:
The
growing
teratoma
syndrome
refers
to
the
phenomenon
whereby
germ
cell
tumors
enlarge
after
chemotherapy
despite
complete
eradication
of
malignant
cells
and
normalization
of
serum
tumor
markers

This
clinical
scenario
must
be
differentiated
from
that
in
which
germ
cell
tumors
maintain
their
malignant
characteristics
with
elevated
levels
of
serum
tumor
markers

METHODS
:
Hospital
record
review
was
conducted
of
2
cases

RESULTS
:
Two
male
patients
are
presented
,
1
with
a
metastatic
germ
cell
tumor
of
both
the
retroperitoneum
and
mediastinum
(
with
elevated
alpha-fetoprotein
level
)
and
1
with
a
primary
germ
cell
tumor
of
the
mediastinum
(
with
elevated
alpha-fetoprotein
and
beta-human
chorionic
gonadotropin
levels
)

After
completion
of
chemotherapy
and
normalization
of
tumor
markers
,
both
patients
presented
with
pulmonary
symptoms
attributable
to
their
massively
enlarging
mediastinal
teratomas
.

The
clinical
and
roentgenographic
features
of
patients
with
thoracic
manifestations
of
the
growing
teratoma
syndrome
,
as
well
as
its
management
,
are
reviewed

CONCLUSIONS
:
After
chemotherapy
in
patients
with
primary
or
metastatic
mediastinal
germ
cell
tumors
whose
tumor
markers
normalize
,
a
growing
mass
in
the
mediastinum
may
represent
the
growing
teratoma
syndrome

The
chicken
calmodulin
I
(
CaMI
)
gene
has
been
isolated
and
characterized
on
the
level
of
cDNA
and
genomic
DNA

The
deduced
amino
acid
(
aa
)
sequence
is
identical
to
the
one
of
chicken
CaMII
which
consists
of
148
aa

The
CaMI
gene
contains
six
exons

Its
intron/exon
organization
is
identical
to
that
of
the
chicken
CaMII
and
the
CaMI
and
CaMIII
genes
of
rat
and
human

Expression
of
the
CaMI
gene
was
detected
in
all
chicken
tissues
examined
,
although
at
varying
levels

The
gene
is
transcribed
into
four
mRNAs
of
0.8
,
1.4
,
1.7
and
4.4
kb
as
determined
by
Northern
blot
analysis

Our
results
demonstrate
that
the
``
multigene-one-protein
''
principle
of
CaM
synthesis
is
not
only
applicable
to
mammals
whose
CaM
is
encoded
by
three
different
genes
,
but
also
to
chickens

BACKGROUND
:
We
assessed
the
accuracy
of
two
electron
beam
computed
tomography
(
EBCT
)
protocols
for
predicting
coronary
events

METHODS
AND
RESULTS
:
In
1994
,
24
months
after
enrollment
in
a
longitudinal
study
,
326
high-risk
adults
underwent
both
3-
and
6-mm
image-slice
thickness
EBCT
scanning
and
were
followed
up
for
32.0+/-4.0
additional
months

Events
were
defined
as
either
coronary
death
,
myocardial
infarction
,
or
revascularization

We
monitored
these
subjects
for
the
32-month
postscanning
period
with
yearly
phone
calls
and
acquisition
of
records
for
all
hospital
admissions

At
the
time
of
scanning
,
11
subjects
(
3
%
)
had
already
suffered
12
events
(
5
infarctions
and
7
revascularizations
)
during
the
24-month
prescanning
period

During
the
postscanning
period
,
18
subjects
(
6
%
)
suffered
23
events
(
5
coronary
deaths
,
6
infarctions
,
and
12
revascularizations
)

Thus
,
28
subjects
(
9
%
)
suffered
35
events

Calcium
quantities
calculated
for
both
protocols
,
performed
on
the
same
subjects
,
were
sorted
in
ascending
order
and
divided
into
equal
quartiles

When
revascularizations
were
included
,
there
was
a
significant
trend
toward
higher
frequencies
of
events
with
increasing
calcium
quantity
(
P
&
#
60
;
.01
)

However
,
coronary
death
and
infarction
were
not
significantly
more
frequent
in
higher
quartiles

These
relationships
were
preserved
in
the
subjects
without
prior
events
at
the
time
of
scanning

CONCLUSIONS
:
Calcium
quantities
from
the
3-mm
and
the
more
reproducible
6-mm
scanning
are
equally
accurate
for
predicting
events

Coronary
calcium
amount
appears
to
be
a
weak
predictor
of
coronary
death
and
infarction

Its
predictive
accuracy
is
superior
for
predicting
revascularization

Research
into
the
genetic
component
of
some
complex
behaviors
often
causes
controversy
,
depending
on
the
social
meaning
and
significance
of
the
behavior
under
study

Research
into
sexual
orientation-simplistically
referred
to
as
``
gay
gene
''
research-is
an
example
of
research
that
provokes
intense
controversy

This
research
is
worrisome
for
many
reasons
,
including
the
fact
that
it
has
been
used
to
harm
lesbians
and
gay
men

Many
homosexual
people
have
been
forced
to
undergo
``
treatments
''
to
change
their
sexual
orientation

Other
chose
to
undergo
them
to
escape
discrimination
and
social
disapprobation

But
there
are
other
reasons
to
worry
about
such
research

The
very
motivation
for
seeking
an
``
origin
''
of
homosexuality
reveals
homophobia

Moreover
,
such
research
may
lead
to
prenatal
tests
that
claim
to
predict
for
homosexuality

For
homosexual
people
who
live
in
countries
with
no
legal
protections
these
dangers
are
particularly
serious

The
efficiency
of
testicular
sperm
retrieval
by
testicular
fine
needle
aspiration
(
TEFNA
)
was
compared
with
open
biopsy
and
testicular
sperm
extraction
(
TESE
)
,
in
37
rigorously
selected
patients
with
non-obstructive
azoospermia

All
patients
underwent
TEFNA
and
TESE
consecutively

Thus
,
each
patient
served
as
his
own
control

The
case
was
regarded
as
successful
if
at
least
one
testicular
spermatozoon
was
found
allowing
intracytoplasmic
sperm
injection
(
ICSI
)
of
at
least
one
oocyte

The
mean
age
of
the
male
patients
was
32.7
years
(
range
24-47
)

Whereas
by
TEFNA
spermatozoa
enabling
performance
of
ICSI
were
found
in
only
four
patients
out
of
37
(
11
%
)
,
open
biopsy
and
TESE
yielded
spermatozoa
in
16
cases
(
43
%
)

The
negative
predictive
value
of
high
serum
follicle
stimulating
hormone
(
FSH
)
concentrations
(
>
or
=10
IU/l
)
(
predicting
failure
to
find
spermatozoa
for
ICSI
)
was
low
(
38.4
%
)

The
positive
predictive
value
(
predicting
the
chance
to
find
spermatozoa
for
ICSI
)
of
normal-sized
testicle
was
not
different
from
that
of
small-sized

Complications
included

in
these
cases
resulted
in
satisfactory
fertilization
and
high
embryo
transfer
rates

The
implantation
and
pregnancy
rates
per
embryo
transfer
were
13
and
29
%
respectively

Neither
serum
FSH
values
nor
testicular
size
were
predictive
of
the
chances
to
find
spermatozoa
for
ICSI

Some
complications
may
occur
even
following
TEFNA

Cyclin
D1
,
the
regulatory
subunit
of
certain
protein
kinases
thought
to
advance
the
G1
phase
of
the
cell
cycle
,
is
now
established
as
a
proto-oncogene
,
with
evidence
indicating
that
its
derangement
may
contribute
to
the
uncontrolled
cell
growth
characteristic
of
tumors

The
chromosomal
translocation
t
(
11
;
14
)
(
q13
:
q32
)
,
involving
rearrangement
of
the
BCL-1
locus
,
is
closely
associated
with
human
lymphoid
neoplasia
affecting
mantle
cell
lymphomas
(
MCL
)

Recently
,
the
putative
BCL-1
proto-oncogene
turned
out
to
be
none
other
than
the
cyclin
D1
gene

Although
the
observed
break
points
in
the
BCL-1
locus
are
not
tightly
clustered
,
its
rearrangement
has
been
documented
in
40-70
%
of
cases
of
mantle
cell
lymphoma
,
whereas
it
only
rarely
occurs
in
other
B
cell
lymphomas

Of
note
,
all
of
the
known
break
points
leave
the
cyclin
D1
coding
region
structurally
intact
and
result
in
increased
protein
expression
,
implying
that
this
may
provide
a
highly
sensitive
and
specific
marker
for
MCL

Recent
studies
demonstrated
that
immunohistochemical
detection
in
paraffin-embedded
material
,
using
a
monoclonal
antibody
,
is
very
useful
for
routine
diagnosis

Current
knowledge
of
cyclin
D1
overexpression
in
malignant
lymphomas
,
with
emphasis
on
its
clinicopathologic
significance
,
is
reviewed

In
the
mammalian
central
nervous
system
,
a
diverse
group
of
basic
helix-loop-helix
(
bHLH
)
proteins
is
involved
in
the
determination
of
progenitor
cells
and
,
subsequently
,
in
regulating
neuronal
differentiation

Here
we
report
the
identification
of
a
novel
subfamily
of
bHLH
proteins
,
defined
by
two
mammalian
enhancer-of-split-
and
hairy-related
proteins
,
termed
SHARP-1
and
SHARP-2

In
contrast
to
known
bHLH
genes
,
detectable
transcription
of
SHARP
genes
begins
at
the
end
of
embryonic
development
marking
differentiated
neurons
that
have
reached
a
final
position
,
and
increases
as
postnatal
development
proceeds

In
the
adult
,
SHARP
genes
are
expressed
in
subregions
of
the
CNS
that
have
been
associated
with
adult
plasticity

In
PC12
cells
,
a
model
system
to
study
neurite
outgrowth
,
SHARP
genes
can
be
induced
by
NGF
with
the
kinetics
of
an
immediate-early
gene

Similarly
,
within
1
h
after
the
administration
of
kainic
acid
in
vivo
,
SHARP-2
is
induced
in
neurons
throughout
the
rat
cerebral
cortex

This
suggests
that
neuronal
bHLH
proteins
are
also
involved
in
the
``
adaptive
''
changes
of
mature
CNS
neurons
which
are
coupled
to
glutamatergic
stimulation

The
embryonic
development
of
the
face
has
been
studied
in
many
reviews
,
this
work
purposes
only
to
clear
up
some
points
which
remain
obscure
concerning
cervico-facial
morphogenesis

In
the
first
part
of
this
study
only
the
facial
development
,
properly
speaking
,
is
considered
,
although
it
can
not
be
separate
of
cervical
development
to
which
a
second
study
will
be
reserved

In
the
present
study
we
recall
the
particular
aspects
of
the
neurulation
in
the
cephalic
area
,
then
the
establishment
of
the
facial
processes

Then
we
approach
among
other
things
the
way
to
consider
the
maxillary
process
with
regard
to
the
other
facial
processes

After
is
considered
constitution
and
natured
of
the
prechordal
plate
which
has
been
diversely
explained

Finally
,
the
modelling
of
the
face
is
evocated
,
in
which
the
dissociation
between
the
olfactive
and
buccal
spheres
is
pointed
out
,
with
the
disparition
of
the
muzzle
,
as
it
is
established
in
the
haplorhinae
,
a
class
of
primates
in
which
the
human
being
is
involved

This
phenomenon
raises
different
questions
,
in
particular
about
the
relation
of
this
disposition
with
the
nasoseptal
center
,
the
medial
part
of
the
nasodorsal
center

A
case-control
study
was
performed
in
eight
pairs
of
women
to
determine
whether
preeclamptic
women
developed
abnormalities
in
minor
hemoglobins
,
glycolytic
enzymes
,
or
other
blood
components
that
might
provide
insight
into
the
pathophysiology
of
preeclampsia
,
or
that
in
combination
might
be
used
as
a
marker
for
the
condition

These
variables
and
standard
clinical
tests
were
analyzed
as
discriminators
between
preeclamptic
and
control
women

The
subjects
were
matched
for
age
,
ethnicity
,
parity
,
and
gestational
age

Blood
samples
were
taken
at
the
time
of
diagnosis
of
preeclampsia
and
at
comparable
gestational
ages
for
matched
normal
controls

Variables
differing
significantly
between
groups
included
increases
in
uric
acid
(
UA
)
,
low-density
lipoproteins
(
LDL
)
,
phosphoglycerate
kinase
(
PGK
)
,
and
mean
platelet
volume
(
MPV
)
,
and
decreases
in
glyceraldehyde
phosphate
dehydrogenase
(
G3PD
)
in
preeclamptic
women
compared
to
normal
controls

Discriminant
analysis
revealed
the
following
function
to
separate
the
groups
:
0.7764
(
UA
)
+
0.8086
(
PGK
)
-0.7032
(
G3PD
)
+
0.1399
(
LDL
)
-0.2386
(
MPV
)

A
discriminant
score
of
>
or
=
275
indicated
a
>
or
=
90
%
probability
of
preeclampsia

The
results
are
consistent
with
perturbations
in
red
cell
glycolysis
in
preeclampsia

Further
prospective
studies
are
warranted
to
test
the
efficacy
of
this
discriminant
function
in
predicting
preeclampsia

A
novel
technique
for
patterning
immobilized
antibody
layers
based
upon
photolithography
and
oxygen
plasma
exposure
has
been
developed

Mouse
monoclonal
antibodies
specific
for
thiabendazole
(
a
post-harvest
fungicide
and
veterinary
anthelmintic
)
were
covalently
linked
through
free
amine
groups
to
aminosilanized
silicon
dioxide
films
using
glutaraldehyde

Immobilized
antibody
layers
were
stabilized
with
sucrose
,
dehydrated
,
and
stored
refrigerated
with
desiccant

Photolithographic
patterning
was
performed
with
a
positive
photoresist
with
modified
bake
temperatures
and
times
,
selective
UV
exposure
with
a
contact
mask
,
and
aqueous
alkaline
solubilization
of
exposed
resist

Exposed
regions
of
immobilized
antibody
were
then
removed
by
exposure
to
a
low
power
,
radio
frequency
oxygen
discharge

Residual
resist
was
stripped
with
acetone

Successful
patterning
was
demonstrated
by
challenging
surfaces
with
goat
anti-mouse
antibody
conjugated
to
tetramethylrhodamine
isothiocyanate

Sucrose
stabilization
was
necessary
for
antibody
to
undergo
photoresist
processing
without
loss
of
binding
activity

Challenge
with
enzyme
linked
antigen
of
oxygen
plasma
exposed
antibody
layers
demonstrated
that
plasma
treatment
completely
neutralized
antibody
capture
ability

Ellipsometry
measurements
of
oxygen
plasma
exposed
antibody
layers
indicated
complete
removal
of
immobilized
antibodies

Fluorescent
imaging
demonstrated
smallest
line
widths
of
2-3
microns

Immune
cells
in
vivo
routinely
perform
highly
selective
immunosensing
in
blood
and
tissues
as
part
of
their
normal
immune
surveillance
functions

We
have
been
investigating
the
potential
of
exploiting
the
immunosensing
detection
abilities
of
excitable
immune
cells
(
i.e
.
the
mast
cell
)
for
the
development
of
whole
cell
immunobiosensors

A
key
feature
is
that
these
immune
cells
can
be
selectively
engineered
to
recognize
specific
antigens
in
vitro

In
the
presence
of
antigen
,
these
cells
undergo
excitable
activation
responses
which
result
in
increased
metabolism
and
the
exocytosis
of
stored
intracellular
mediators

We
have
previously
determined
that
mast
cell
metabolic
responses
can
be
thermally
transduced
in
real
time
,
thus
indicating
the
possibility
of
whole
cell
thermoelectric
immunobiosensing

In
this
work
we
investigated
the
use
of
enzyme
amplification
systems
to
enhance
the
direct
transduction
of
immune
cell
responses
to
analyte

It
was
found
that
with
appropriate
enzymes
,
peak
outputs
occurred
within
approximately
5
min
(
4-20
times
faster
than
without
enzymes
)
and
peak
response
magnitudes
were
up
to
nine-fold
greater
than
without
enzymes

An
easy-to-use
technique
for
detection
of
antibodies
specific
for
the
parasite
L.
donovani
in
human
serum
sample
has
been
developed

The
method
is
based
on
an
evanescent
wave
generated
from
a
tapered
configuration
of
decladded
optical
fibre
and
does
not
require
any
volumetric
measurement

Tapered
fibres
are
immobilized
with
the
purified
cell
surface
protein
of
L.
donovani
by
covalent
bonding

Treated
fibres
are
incubated
with
the
patient
serum
for
10
min
followed
by
incubation
with
goat
anti
human
IgG
tagged
FITC

Fluorescent
intensity
from
the
fibre
has
been
shown
to
be
proportional
to
L.
donovani
specific
antibodies
present
in
the
test
sera

Direct
readings
can
be
obtained
after
signal
enhancement
through
a
photomultiplier
tube
within
5
min

The
system
,
when
tested
on
12
positive
sera
,
did
not
show
any
false
negative
result

Also
,
no
false
positive
result
was
obtained
with
serum
samples
of
patients
infected
with
leprosy
,
tuberculosis
,
typhoid
and
malaria
,
showing
the
specificity
of
the
sensor
and
efficacy
of
the
technique

We
present
an
optical
biosensor
design
that
expands
the
utility
of
enzyme
biosensors

These
biosensors
are
fabricated
by
site-selective
photodeposition
of
analyte-sensitive
polymer
matrices
on
optical
imaging
fibres

These
dual-analyte
arrays
allow
for
the
simultaneous
,
independent
measurement
of
the
analyte
of
interest
and
the
transducing
analyte

The
first
integrated
optical-biosensors
using
this
design
have
been
prepared
that
allow
both
the
dependent
and
independent
analytes
to
be
measured
simultaneously
,
for
example
penicillin
and
pH
(
Healey
&
#
38
;
Walt
,
1995
)
or
glucose
and
O2
(
Li
&
#
38
;
Walt
,
1995
)

Independent
measurement
of
the
transducing
analyte
allows
penicillin
or
glucose
to
be
quantitated
in
the
presence
of
a
concurrent
pH
or
O2
change
,
respectively

Penicillin
can
be
measured
in
the
range
0.25-10.0
mM
in
the
pH
range
6.2-7.5

Glucose
can
be
measured
in
the
range
0.6-20.0
mM
in
the
O2
range
20-100
%

The
utility
of
the
sensor
design
was
demonstrated
by
using
the
penicillin-dual-analyte
biosensor
to
quantitate
penicillin
produced
during
a
Penicillium
chrysogenum
fermentation

The
characterization
of
low
molecular
weight
ligand
interaction
with
receptor
molecules
is
of
importance
for
the
investigation
of
biological
processes
and
for
drug
research

We
report
on
the
investigation
of
the
binding
of
low
molecular
weight
ligands
to
immobilized
receptors
by
label-free
detection

Reflectometric
interference
spectroscopy
,
an
optical
transducer
which
allows
the
monitoring
of
a
few
picograms
per
square
millimetre
changes
in
surface
coverage
,
was
used
to
study
two
model
systems

In
both
cases
detection
of
the
binding
event
was
successful

High
affinity
binding
of
biotin
to
immobilized
streptavidin
was
clearly
detectable
at
receptor
surface
concentrations
as
low
as
1-2
x
10
(
10
)
binding
sites/mm2

Linear
correlation
between
the
receptor
surface
concentration
and
the
response
to
biotin
binding
was
observed

Using
immobilized
DNA
,
we
investigated
the
binding
of
common
intercalators
with
respect
to
kinetics
and
thermodynamics
by
evaluation
of
the
association
and
the
dissociation
part
of
the
binding
curve

Bi-exponential
increase
and
decrease
of
intercalator
loading
was
observed
,
indicating
complex
interaction
kinetics

The
four
structurally
different
intercalators
showed
significant
distinction
in
binding
kinetics
and
equilibrium
signals

Improvement
of
experimental
parameters
is
required
to
obtain
more
reliable
kinetic
data

An
amperometric
lactate
oxidase
catheter
has
been
developed
for
in
vivo
application
to
real-time
lactate
monitoring

The
electrochemical
behaviour
of
the
1
x
3
mm
Pt-Ag/AgCl
thin
film
electrode
is
not
significantly
influenced
by
lactate
oxidase-polyurethane
covering

Gamma-irradiation
(
25
kGy
)
is
suitable
for
the
sterilization
procedure

The
final
lactate
catheter
is
characterized
by
a
linear
concentration
range
between
0.5
and
20
mmol/l
lactate
with
a
sensitivity
around
2
nA
mmol-1
l-1
lactate

The
accuracy
is
demonstrated
by
the
measurement
of
control
sera

Both
physiological
and
pathological
materials
correlate
well
with
the
declared
values

The
dry
stored
lactate
catheter
needs
about
10
min
for
hydration
and
is
characterized
by
response
times
t98
%
of
less
than
2
min

Ex
vivo
whole
blood
measurements
using
the
lactate
catheter
(
y
)
give
a
correlation
with
the
BIOSEN
Med
L
(

)
of
y
=
(
1.010x
+
0.513
)
mmol/l
(
r
=
0.9748
)

Lactate
values
obtained
by
continuous
catheter
operation
ex
vivo
correlate
well
with
those
obtained
by
BIOSEN
Med
L.
First
subcutaneous
implantation
(
dog
)
underlines
the
characteristics
obtained
ex
vivo
:
after
30
min
hydration
the
lactate
catheter
follows
the
lactate
concentration
measured
ex
vivo
with
samples
from
the
leg

by
BIOSEN
Med

The
diffusion-limited
binding
kinetics
of
antigen
(
or
antibody
)
in
solution
to
antibody
(
or
antigen
)
immobilized
on
a
biosensor
and
other
surfaces
is
analyzed
within
a
fractal
framework

Often
,
the
binding
kinetics
may
be
described
by
a
single-fractal
analysis

In
some
cases
,
the
binding
curve
exhibits
complexities

Then
,
for
these
cases
,
the
dual-fractal
analysis
provides
an
improved
fit
when
compared
with
a
single-fractal
analysis

This
indicates
a
change
in
the
reaction
mechanism
on
the
surface

It
is
of
interest
to
note
that
the
state
of
disorder
(
or
the
fractal
dimension
)
and
the
binding
rate
coefficient
both
increase
as
the
reaction
progresses
on
the
biosensor
surface

For
example
,
for
the
binding
of
10
nM
insulin
growth
factor-1
in
solution
to
insulin
growth
factor
binding
protein-1
immobilized
on
a
biosensor
surface
,
a
64
%
increase
in
the
fractal
dimension
from
1.73
(
Df1
)
to
2.85
(
Df2
)
leads
to
an
increase
in
the
binding
rate
coefficient
by
a
factor
of
31.8
from
3.92
(
k1
)
to
125
(
k2
)

Furthermore
,
as
the
IGF-1
concentration
in
solution
increases
from
10
to
80
nM
in
solution
,
k2
and
Df2
exhibit
a
linear
increase

k1
and
Df1
exhibit
a
linear
increase
with
the
reciprocal
of
the
IGF-1
concentration
in
solution

The
different
examples
analyzed
and
presented
together
provide
a
means
by
which
the
antigen-antibody
reactions
may
be
better
controlled
by
noting
the
magnitude
of
the
changes
in
the
fractal
dimension
and
in
the
binding
rate
coefficient
as
the
reaction
progresses
on
the
biosensor
surface

Also
,
the
magnitude
of
the
changes
in
the
binding
rate
coefficients
(
k1
and
k2
)
and
in
the
fractal
dimensions
(
Df1
and
Df2
)
as
different
parameters
are
changed
for
the
different
biosensor
applications
are
of
particular
value
,
since
they
provide
us
with
a
measure
or
extent
of
changes
in
the
binding
rate
coefficient
on
changing
different
experimental
parameter
values

It
is
of
interest
to
note
the
effect
of
different
parameters
on
the
extent
or
heterogeneity
that
exists
on
the
surface
and
how
this
influences
the
binding
rate
coefficients

This
may
be
one
method
to
help
manipulate
or
control
the
binding
rate
coefficients
on
the
reaction
surface

To
determine
if
microscopic
urinalysis
is
needed
in
all
pediatric
emergency
room
patients
screened
for
urinary
tract
infections
(
UTI
)
,
we
compared
the
dipstick
urinalysis
and
complete
urinalysis
(
dipstick
and
microscopy
)
with
urine
cultures
in
236
children
,
aged
3
weeks
to
21
years

The
ability
to
detect
UTI
by
dipstick
only
and
by
complete
urinalysis
was
the
same
,
however
microscopic
evaluation
added
many
false-positive
results
without
detecting
additional
UTIs

Because
the
ability
to
detect
UTI
(
sensitivity
)
is
maintained
,
we
now
offer
a
dipstick
only
urinalysis
to
our
emergency
room
for
children
2
years
of
age
or
older
,
with
a
microscopic
analysis
performed
automatically
if
dipstick
results
are
positive

If
no
microscopic
urinalysis
is
required
,
testing
turn-around
time
is
reduced
by
12.3
min/test
and
the
hospital
charge
is
reduced
from
U.S

32
to
U.S

Using
video-intensified
fluorescence
microscopy
and
a
pseudocolor
display
of
fluorescence
intensity
,
we
analyzed
the
distribution
of
microinjected

within
the
nurse-cell/oocyte
syncytium
of
Drosophila
ovarian
follicles

We
varied
the
composition
and
the
osmolarity
of
the
culture
solution
as
well
as
the
electrical
charge
and
the
molecular
mass
of
the
microinjected
fluorescent
probe

As
culture
solutions
,
we
used
four
simple
salines
(
IMADS
)
and
a
complex
tissue-culture
medium
(
R-14
)
that
matched
the
osmolarity
of
adult
hemolymph

Small
amounts
of
two
anionic
dyes
(
Lucifer
Yellow
CH
and
Lucifer
Yellow
dextran
)
as
well
as
of
two
cationic
dyes
(
rhodamine
6G
and
tetramethylrhodamine
dextran-lysine
)
were
iontophoretically
microinjected
either
into
a
nurse
cell
or
into
the
oocyte
of
stage-10
follicles

In
the
tissue-culture
medium
,
within
a
few
seconds
following
microinjection
,
all
tested
dyes
passed
through
the
intercellular
bridges
in
both
the
anterior
direction
(
to
the
nurse
cells
)
and
the
posterior
direction
(
to
the
oocyte
)
,
independent
of
their
electrical
charge
or
molecular
mass

In
all
simple
salines
,
irrespective
of
their
osmolarity
,
Lucifer
Yellow
CH
was
found
to
preferentially
migrate
in
the
posterior
direction
and
to
accumulate
in
the
oocyte
due
to
progressive
binding
to
yolk
spheres

Thus
,
with
this
sensitive
method
,
no
correlation
was
detectable
between
the
external
osmolarity
,
the
electrical
charge
and
the
preferential
direction
of
migration
of
a
microinjected
probe

Our
results
indicate
that
the
electrical
gradient
described
by
other
authors
does
not
exert
significant
influence
on
the
migration
of
charged
molecules
through
intercellular
bridges
in
situ

The
AF-4
gene
on
human
chromosome
4q21
is
involved
in
reciprocal
translocations
to
the
ALL-1
gene
on
chromosome
11q23
,
which
are
associated
with
acute
lymphoblastic
leukaemias

A
set
of
recombinant
phage
carrying
genomic
fragments
for
the
coding
region
and
flanking
sequences
of
the
AF-4
gene
were
isolated

Phage
inserts
were
assembled
into
four
contigs
with
21
exons
,
and
an
intron
phase
map
was
produced
enabling
the
interpretation
of
translocation-generated
fusion
proteins

The
gene
contains
two
alternative
first
exons
,
1a
and
1b
,
both
including
a
translation
initiation
codon

The
translocation
breakpoint
cluster
region
is
flanked
by
exons
3
and
6
and
two
different
polyadenylation
signals
were
identified

Polyclonal
antisera
directed
against
three
different
portions
of
the
AF-4
protein
were
produced
and
used
to
detect
a
116
kD
protein
in
cellular
extracts
of
human
B-lymphoblastoid
and
proB
cell
lines

In
mitogen-stimulated
human
peripheral
blood
mononuclear
cells
the
AF-4
antigen
was
predominantly
located
in
the
nucleus

The
AF-4
gene
is
a
member
of
the
AF-4
,
LAF-4
and
FMR-2
gene
family

The
members
of
this
family
encode
serine-proline-rich
proteins
with
properties
of
nuclear
transcription
factors

Comparison
of
AF-4
protein
coding
sequences
with
the
LAF-4
and
FMR-2
sequences
revealed
five
highly
conserved
domains
of
potential
functional
relevance

Immunoglobulin
superfamily
molecules
in
the
brain
are
involved
in
distinct
aspects
of
nervous
system
histogenesis
,
for
example
neuronal
migration
and
axonal
growth

To
identify
novel
members
of
this
superfamily
in
the
chick
nervous
system
,
we
developed
a
polymerase
chain
reaction-based
approach
making
use
of
sequence
motifs
of
immunoglobulin-like
domains

In
the
present
study
,
we
report
the
molecular
cloning
of
three
isoforms
,
the
biochemical
analysis
and
the
immunohistochemical
characterization
of
one
of
the
proteins
identified
in
this
screen

This
molecule
has
91
%
sequence
identity
with
the
limbic
system-associated
membrane
protein
(
LAMP
)
characterized
in
the
rat
and
is
therefore
referred
to
as
the
chicken
homologue
of
the
latter
(
chLAMP
)

The
molecule
is
a
glycosylphosphatidyl-inositol-anchored
60
kDa
protein
with
three
immunoglobulin-like
domains
and
contains
40
%
N-linked
carbohydrate

We
identify
three
different
mRNA
forms
of
chLAMP
and
show
that
two
forms
with
distinct
5'-termini
are
differentially
transcribed
in
neural
development

In
addition
,
we
demonstrate
using
a
fusion
protein
expressed
in
eukaryotic
cells
that
chLAMP
has
homophilic
binding
activity

The
protein
was
found
on
a
subset
of
axons
in
the
central
and
peripheral
nervous
system
and
is
likely
to
be
involved
in
specific
cell-cell
interactions
in
neurohistogenesis

Two
novel
cDNAs
,
DNAS1L2
and
DNAS1L3
,
are
predicted
to
encode
proteins
of
299
and
305
amino
acids
with
56
and
46
%
residue
identity
(
71
and
63
%
similarity
)
,
respectively
,
to
deoxyribonuclease
I
(
DNase
I
)

DNAS1L2
is
located
on
a
16p13.3
cosmid
,
while
DNAS1L3
maps
to
3p14.3-p21.1
by
fluorescence
in
situ
hybridization
and
by
PCR
analysis
of
a
radiation
hybrid
panel

Northern
analysis
revealed
DNAS1L3
expression
nearly
exclusively
in
liver
,
while
DNAS1L2
expression
was
detected
in
brain
by
RT-PCR

The
previously
defined
DNL1L
or
DNAS1L1
is
expressed
highest
in
heart
and
skeletal
muscle
,
while
DNase
I
is
expressed
in
the
pancreas
,
parotid
gland
,
and
kidney

Thus
,
to
date
,
four
DNase
I-like
genes
that
show
different
tissue
expression
patterns
are
known

A
comparison
of
DNAS1L1
,
DNAS1L2
,
and
DNAS1L3
with
the
well-characterized
DNase
I
suggests
that
the
DNAS1L
proteins
are
unlikely
to
be
glycosylated
or
bind
actin
;
however
,
catalytic
and
calcium-
and
DNA-binding
residues
are
conserved
,
and
potentially
cleavable
signal
peptides
are
present
among
all
these
proteins

This
analysis
also
identifies
regions
of
high
conservation
among
these
proteins
with
no
currently
assigned
function

Two
different
responses
to
the
therapy
were
observed
in
a
group
of
patients
receiving
the
protease
inhibitor
indinavir

In
one
,
suppression
of
virus
replication
occurred
and
has
persisted
for
90
weeks
(
bDNA
,
&
#
60
;
500
human
immunodeficiency
virus
type
1
(
HIV-1
)
RNA
copies/ml
)

In
the
second
group
,
a
rebound
in
virus
levels
in
plasma
followed
the
initial
sharp
decline
observed
at
the
start
of
therapy

This
was
associated
with
the
emergence
of
drug-resistant
variants

Sequence
analysis
of
the
protease
gene
during
the
course
of
therapy
revealed
that
in
this
second
group
there
was
a
sequential
acquisition
of
protease
mutations
at
amino
acids
46
,
82
,
54
,
71
,
89
,
and
90

In
the
six
patients
in
this
group
,
there
was
also
an
identical
mutation
in
the
gag
p7/p1
gag
protease
cleavage
site

In
three
of
the
patients
,
this
change
was
seen
as
early
as
6
to
10
weeks
after
the
start
of
therapy

In
one
patient
,
a
second
mutation
occurred
at
the
gag
p1/p6
cleavage
site
,
but
it
appeared
18
weeks
after
the
time
of
appearance
of
the
p7/p1
mutation

Recombinant
HIV-1
variants
containing
two
or
three
mutations
in
the
protease
gene
were
constructed
either
with
mutations
at
the
p7/p1
cleavage
site
or
with
wild-type
(
WT
)
gag
sequences

When
recombinant
HIV-1-containing
protease
mutations
at
46
and
82
was
grown
in
MT2
cells
,
there
was
a
68
%
reduction
in
its
rate
of
replication
compared
to
the
WT
virus

Introduction
of
an
additional
mutation
at
the
gag
p7/p1
protease
cleavage
site
compensated
for
the
partially
defective
protease
gene

Similarly
,
rates
of
replication
of
viruses
with
mutations
M46L/I
,
I54V
,
and
V82A
in
protease
were
enhanced
both
in
the
presence
and
in
the
absence
of
Indinavir
when
combined
with
mutations
in
the
gag
p7/p1
and
the
gag
p1/p6
cleavage
sites

Optimal
rates
of
virus
replication
require
protease
cleavage
of
precursor
polyproteins

A
mutation
in
the
cleavage
site
that
enhanced
the
availability
of
a
protein
that
was
rate
limiting
for
virus
maturation
would
confer
on
that
virus
a
significant
growth
advantage
and
may
explain
the
uniform
emergence
of
viruses
with
alterations
at
the
p7/p1
cleavage
site

This
is
the
first
report
of
the
emergence
of
mutations
in
the
gag
p7/p1
protease
cleavage
sites
in
patients
receiving
protease
therapy
and
identifies
this
change
as
an
important
determinant
of
HIV-1
resistance
to
protease
inhibitors
in
patient
populations

A
novel
intracellular
calcium-binding
protein
from
Echinococcus
granulosus
is
described
in
this
work

A
cDNA
was
isolated
from
a
lambdagt11
protoscolex
expression
library
and
the
deduced
amino
acid
sequence
has
at
least
fifteen
sequentially
repeated
twelve-residue
repeats
that
resemble
the
calcium-binding
loop
of
EF-hands
;
however
,
the
dodecamer
motif
has
no
flanking
helices

The
cDNA
was
expressed
in
Escherichia
coli
using
the
pGEX
vector
,
and
a
recombinant
fusion
protein
(
EgCaBP1-GST
)
was
obtained

The
recombinant
fusion
protein
binds
calcium
when
assayed
with
45Ca

It
is
possible
that
the
calcium-binding
motifs
present
a
secondary
structure
similar
to
the
parallel
beta
roll
structure
described
for
an
alkaline
protease
from
Pseudomonas
aeruginosa

A
native
protein
of
more
than
300
kDa
was
recognized
by
an
anti-EgCaBP1
monoclonal
antibody
by
Western-blot
analysis

Immunohistochemistry
using
a
pool
of
anti-EgCaBP1-GST
mouse
sera
demonstrated
a
strong
association
of
the
protein
with
calcareous
corpuscles

The
possible
role
of
this
protein
and
that
of
the
calcareous
corpuscles
in
the
protoscolex
are
discussed

The
enzyme
activity
of
mitogen-activated
protein
kinase
(
MAP
kinase
)
increases
in
response
to
agents
acting
on
a
variety
of
cell
surface
receptors
,
including
receptors
linked
to
heterotrimeric
G
proteins

In
this
report
,
we
demonstrated
that
Raf-1
protein
kinase
activity
in
the
mouse
parotid
glands
was
induced
by
chronic
isoproterenol
administration
in
whole
animals

To
investigate
the
molecular
nature
underlying
cellular
responses
to
Raf-1
activation
,
we
have
stably
transfected
rat
salivary
epithelial
Pa-4
cells
with
human
Raf-1-estrogen
receptor
fusion
gene
(
DeltaRaf-1
:
ER
)
and
used
mRNA
differential
display
in
search
of
messages
induced
by
DeltaRaf-1
:
ER
activation

Through
this
approach
,
the
gene
encoding
non-histone
chromosomal
protein
HMGI-C
was
identified
as
one
of
the
target
genes
activated
by
oncogenic
Raf-1
kinase

Activation
of
Raf-1
kinase
resulted
in
a
delayed
and
sustained
increase
of
HMGI-C
expression
in
the
Pa-4
cells

The
induction
of
HMGI-C
mRNA
level
is
sensitive
to
both
the
protein
synthesis
inhibitor
cycloheximide
and
transcription
inhibitor
actinomycin
D

The
role
of
the
extracellular
signal-related
kinase
(
ERK
)
signaling
pathway
in
the
HMGI-C
induction
was
highlighted
by
the
result
that
the
MAP
kinase
kinase
(
MEK
)
inhibitor
,
PD
98059
,
blocked
DeltaRaf-1
:
ER-
and
12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-stimulated
HMGI-C
induction

Altogether
,
these
findings
support
the
notion
that
the
Raf/MEK/ERK
signaling
module
,
at
least
in
part
,
regulates
transcriptional
activation
of
the
chromosomal
architectural
protein
HMGI-C

Pendred
syndrome
is
a
recessively
inherited
disorder
with
the
hallmark
features
of
congenital
deafness
and
thyroid
goitre

By
some
estimates
,
the
disorder
may
account
for
upwards
of
10
%
of
hereditary
deafness

Previous
genetic
linkage
studies
localized
the
gene
to
a
broad
interval
on
human
chromosome
7q22-31.1

Using
a
positional
cloning
strategy
,
we
have
identified
the
gene
(
PDS
)
mutated
in
Pendred
syndrome
and
found
three
apparently
deleterious
mutations
,
each
segregating
with
the
disease
in
the
respective
families
in
which
they
occur

PDS
produces
a
transcript
of
approximately
5
kb
that
was
found
to
be
expressed
at
significant
levels
only
in
the
thyroid

The
predicted
protein
,
pendrin
,
is
closely
related
to
a
number
of
known
sulphate
transporters

These
studies
provide
compelling
evidence
that
defects
in
pendrin
cause
Pendred
syndrome
thereby
launching
a
new
area
of
investigation
into
thyroid
physiology
,
the
pathogenesis
of
congenital
deafness
and
the
role
of
altered
sulphate
transport
in
human
disease

We
report
the
cDNA
cloning
,
partial
genomic
organization
,
and
expression
pattern
of
Stra10
,
a
novel
retinoic
acid-inducible
gene
in
P19
embryonal
carcinoma
cells

Four
murine
cDNA
isoforms
have
been
isolated
,
which
are
likely
to
result
from
alternative
splicing

The
predicted
protein
sequences
exhibit
approximately
85
%
identity
with
the
Pbx-related
Meis1
homeobox
gene
products
,
which
are
involved
in
myeloid
leukemia
in
BXH-2
mice
,
and
one
of
the
Stra10
isoforms
corresponds
to
the
recently
published
Meis2
sequence
(
Nakamura
et
al
.
(
1996
)
Oncogene
13
:
2235-2242
)

The
Meis2
homeodomain
is
identical
to
that
of
Meis1
,
and
is
most
closely
related
to
those
of
the
Pbx/TGIF
homeobox
gene
products

By
in
situ
hybridization
analysis
,
we
show
that
the
Meis2
gene
displays
spatially
restricted
expression
patterns
in
the
developing
nervous
system
,
limbs
,
face
,
and
in
various
viscera

In
adult
mice
,
Meis2
is
mainly
expressed
in
the
brain
and
female
genital
tract
,
with
a
different
distribution
of
the
alternative
splice
forms
in
these
organs

A
methodical
strategy
for
the
isolation
of
microsatellite
markers
specific
for
targeted
regions
of
bovine
chromosomes
is
presented

The
procedure
involves
directed
microdissection
of
one
defined
subchromosomal
area
,
its
DOP-PCR-amplification
and
cloning

With
this
approach
,
a
library
specific
to
the
BTA
6q21-31
chromosomal
region
was
constructed

Eleven
unique
microsatellite-containing
sequences
were
isolated
,
converted
into
sequence-tagged
microsatellite
sites
,
and
characterized
concerning
their
species-specific
origin

Seven
primer
pairs
generated
bovine-specific
PCR
products
and
provided
a
set
of
microsatellite
markers
that
generally
revealed
high
informativity
in
the
HF
breed

Linkage
analysis
assigned
six
of
them
to
their
predefined
subchromosomal
origin
on
BTA
6
corresponding
to
the
specific
rehybridization
signal
of
the
DOP-PCR
product
generated
from
the
microdissected
chromosome
area
6q21-31

The
results
underline
the
usefulness
of
the
BTA
6q21-31
library
for
targeted
isolation
of
unique
sequences
that
are
specific
for
the
dissected
chromosomal
region
as
demonstrated
here
by
the
isolation
of
microsatellite
markers

Phylogeographic
structure
was
determined
for
the
yellow
mongoose
,
Cynictis
penicillata
,
using
mtDNA
RFLPs
and
control
region
sequences

The
RFLP
analysis
revealed
13
haplotypes
which
showed
weak
geographical
patterning
consistent
with
a
recent
range
expansion
from
a
refugial
population
(
s
)

An
analysis
of
molecular
variance
(
AMOVA
)
revealed
no
correspondence
between
mtDNA
phylogeography
and
subspecies
delimitation
,
nor
between
matrilines
and
areas
characterized
by
a
high
incidence
of
the
viverrid-type
rabies
,
of
which
the
yellow
mongoose
is
the
principal
vector

The
lack
of
structure
was
also
shown
by
control
region
sequences
although
four
of
the
maternal
lineages
shared
a
near-perfect
81
bp
repeat

We
speculate
that
regional
hot
spots
of
the
viverrid
rabies
biotype
reflect
population
density
differences
in
the
yellow
mongoose
that
are
not
underscored
by
genetic
partitioning
,
at
least
at
the
level
of
resolution
provided
by
our
analyses

The
indoor
pollution
,
where
the
patients
pass
in
general
close
to
90
%
of
their
time
,
is
an
important
factor
to
take
in
consideration
if
one
wants
to
evaluate
suitably
the
effects
of
the
air
pollution
on
the
health

Causes
of
this
kind
of
pollution
are
partially
linked
to
the
external
pollution
and
the
outdoor
environment
and
also
are
function
of
human
activities
and
introduced
products
in
the
habitat
(
heating
,
tabagisme
,
handywork
,
products
of
maintenance
,
coatings
,
materials
of
construction
,
etc

)

The
effects
on
health
are
as
various
as
the
pollutants
,
going
from
sharp
intoxication
to
irritations
or
simply
desagreements

In
this
problem
of
public
health
we
may
not
underestimated
sensitive
persons
and
risky
group
as
well
as
long
terme
effects
,
and
chronic
exposition
effects

The
search
of

needs
multiple
competences
from
the

an
essential

Dioxins
are
a
family
of
chlorinated
aromatic
hydrocarbons
that
are
produced
during
combustion
processes
in
the
presence
of
a
chlorine
donor
and
as
by-products
of
the
chlorine-processing
chemical
industries

Several
dioxins
are
extremely
stable

persist

Exposure
to
dioxins
occurs
mainly
via
the
ingestion
of
contaminated
food

The
lipophilic
character
of
dioxins
prevents
their
excretion
in
the
urine
and
causes
their
accumulation
in
body
fat

The
mechanisms
of
dioxin
action
are
similar
to
those
of
a
hormone

Dioxins
bind
to
a
specific
intracellular
receptor
and
the
complex
acts
as
a
transcription
factor
that
induces
the
production
of
a
great
number
of
proteins

Certain
dioxins
,
particularly
2
,
3
,
7
,
8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin
,
are
very
toxic
and
able
to
induce
numerous
clinical
conditions

The
carcinogenicity
of
dioxins
is
well
documented
in
animal
models
and
has
been
described
in
humans
after
professional
and
accidental
exposures

Recent
experimental
data
also
indicate
that
dioxins
can
cause
dysfunction
of
the
sexual
and
thyroid
hormone
systems
and
that
the
administration
of
dioxins
induces
several
conditions
related
to
hormonal
dysfunction

Chronic
exposure
of
female
Rhesus
monkeys
increases
the
incidence
and
severity
of
endometriosis

The
administration
of
dioxins
during
pregnancy
and
nursing
causes
altered
development
of
the
reproductive
system
,
decreased
spermatogenesis
,
hypothyroidism
and
disturbed
psychomotor
development
in
the
offspring

The
particular
sensibility
of
the
fetus
and
newborn
is
of
concern
because
the
exposition
to
dioxins
is
particularly
important
during
those
periods
of
life

In
humans
a
series
of
conditions
related
to
hormonal
dysfunction
as
undescended
testis
,
decreased
spermatogenesis
,
testicular
cancer
and
endometriosis
have
increased
in
incidence
during
the
last
decades

The
chronological
parallelism
with
the
appearance
of
dioxins
in
the
environment
suggests
that
these
might
exert
biological
effects
at
the
prevailing
level
of
exposure

Nevertheless
this
hypothesis
is
currently
unconfirmed
by
epidemiological
studies

The
implications
of
this
scientific
incertitude
for
the
implementation
of
preventive
measures
are
briefly
discussed

This
presentation
summarizes
the
debate
on
the
suggested
progressive
impairment
of
semen
quality
(
the
``
sperm
fall
''
)
in
the
last
forty
years
in
the
developed
countries

The
various
available
data
strongly
suggesting
an
environmental
toxic
origin
for
the
``
sperm
fall
''
will
be
presented
as
well
as
the
most
frequently
suspected
class
of
substances
,
the
xenoestrogens

Diabetes
mellitus
is
a
still
growing
disease

New
diagnostic
criteria
lowered
the
cut
off
value
to
126
mg/dl
,
in
order
to
detect
more
rapidly
diabetes
and
its
complications

The
treatment
of
diabetes
2
by
the
classic
oral
antidiabetic
drugs
(
sulfamides
and
biguanides
)
is
completed
by
intestinal
glycosidases
inhibitors
and
thiazolidendiones

These
last
drugs
seem
very
attractive
because
they
decrease
insulin
resistance
in
obese
,
diabetics

Their
hepatic
side
effects
must
be
however
under
control

Better
knowledge
of
non
lipidic
effects
of
statins
on
the
arterial
wall
and
the
discovery
of
the
action
of
fibrates
on
PPAR
(
Peroxisome
Proliferator
Activated
Receptors
)
improved
strongly
the
therapeutic
management
of
hyperlipidemias

Recent
intervention
studies
have
demonstrated
the
necessity
to
treat
vigorously
dysipidemias

Despite
Beta-blockade
therapy
has
been
considered
as
an
absolute
contraindication
in
the
treatment
of
heart
failure
,
it
has
been
shown
that
they
could
have
a
beneficial
effect
,
provided
that
they
were
introduced
at
very
low
dose
,
and
very
progressively
in
addition
of
the
traditional
treatment

The
advances
in
the
understanding
of
the
neuro-hormonal
mechanisms
of
heart
failure
have
modified
the
therapeutic
strategy
:
the
deleterious
effect
of
the
activation
of
the
sympathetic
nervous
system
on
the
myocardium
has
served
as
the
rationale
for
randomized
clinical
trials
comparing
beta-blockade
to
placebo
:
the
current
data
are
promising
,
suggesting
a
beneficial
effect
on
survival
as
well
as
on
quality
of
life

However
,
these
results
have
to
be
confirmed
by
larger
trials
,
currently
underway
,
before
to
consider
that
beta-blockade
should
definitely
be
incorporated
in
the
treatment
of
heart
failure

Calcium
antagonists
have
been
used
for
treatment
of
cardiovascular
diseases
for
more
than
25
years

Several
recent
retrospective
studies
have
suggested
that
chronic
treatment
with
short-acting
dihydropyridines
increased
the
incidence
of
cardiac
events
,
cancer
and
gastrointestinal
bleedings

Randomized
prospective
studies
have
,
however
,
never
been
able
to
confirm
these
observations

In
addition
,
well-conducted
studies
using
verapamil
and
diltiazem
have
suggested
that
these
calcium
antagonists
may
even
improve
cardiovascular
mortality
and
morbidity
of
the
hypertensive
patient

<
TO_SEE
>
There
is
therefore
no
reason
to
believe
that
the
questionable
results
derived
from
retrospective
studies
of
the
effects
of
short-acting
calcium
antagonists
on
cardiac
and
noncardiac
events
may
apply
to
the
newer
generation
of
long-acting
calcium
antagonists

Sumatriptan
and
other
selective
serotonin
agonists
represent
a
major
breakthrough
in
acute
migraine
treatment

These
drugs
are
very
efficacious
and
generally
devoided
of
important
side
effects
,
but
they
are
expensive
and
therefore
have
to
be
compared
with
other
,
more
conventional
drugs
with
established
or
assumed
efficacy

We
summarize
the
pharmacologic
characteristics
of
Sumatriptan
and
give
recommendations
about
its
use
in
clinical
practice

Fiercer
competition
between
athletes
and
a
wider
knowledge
of
optimal
training
regimens
dramatically
influence
current
training
methods

A
single
training
bout
per
day
was
previously
considered
sufficient
,
whereas
today
athletes
regularly
train
twice
a
day
or
more

Consequently
,
the
number
of
athletes
who
are
overtraining
and
have
insufficient
rest
is
increasing

Positive
overtraining
can
be
regarded
as
a
natural
process
when
the
end
result
is
adaptation
and
improved
performance
:
the
supercompensation
principle
--
which
includes
the
breakdown
process
(
training
)
followed
by
the
recovery
process
(
rest
)
--
is
well
known
in
sports

However
,
negative
overtraining
,
causing
maladaptation
and
other
negative
consequences
such
as
staleness
,
can
occur

Physiological
,
psychological
,
biochemical
and
immunological
symptoms
must
be
considered
,
both
independently
and
together
,
to
fully
understand
the
'staleness
'
syndrome

However
,
psychological
testing
may
reveal
early-warning
signs
more
readily
than
the
various
physiological
or
immunological
markers

The
time
frame
of
training
and
recovery
is
also
important
since
the
consequences
of
negative
overtraining
comprise
an
overtraining-response
continuum
from
short
to
long
term
effects

An
athlete
failing
to
recover
within
72
hours
has
presumably
negatively
overtrained
and
is
in
an
overreached
state

For
an
elite
athlete
to
refrain
from
training
for
>
72
hours
is
extremely
undesirable
,
highlighting
the
importance
of
a
carefully
monitored
recovery
process

There
are
many
methods
used
to
measure
the
training
process
but
few
with
which
to
match
the
recovery
process
against
it

One
such
framework
for
this
is
referred
to
as
the
total
quality
recovery
(
TQR
)
process

By
using
a
TQR
scale
,
structured
around
the
scale
developed
for
ratings
of
perceived
exertion
(
RPE
)
,
the
recovery
process
can
be
monitored
and
matched
against
the
breakdown
(
training
)
process
(
TQR
versus
RPE
)

The
TQR
scale
emphasises
both
the
athlete
's
perception
of
recovery
and
the
importance
of
active
measures
to
improve
the
recovery
process

Furthermore
,
directing
attention
to
psychophysiological
cues
serves
the
same
purpose
as
in
RPE
,
i.e
.
increasing
self-awareness

This
article
reviews
and
conceptualises
the
whole
overtraining
process

In
doing
so
,
it
(
i
)
aims
to
differentiate
between
the
types
of
stress
affecting
an
athlete
's
performance
:
(
ii
)
identifies
factors
influencing
an
athlete
's
ability
to
adapt
to
physical
training
:
(
iii
)
structures
the
recovery
process

The
TQR
method
to
facilitate
monitoring
of
the
recovery
process
is
then
suggested
and
a
conceptual
model
that
incorporates
all
of
the
important
parameters
for
performance
gain
(
adaptation
)
and
loss
(
maladaptation
)

Little
attention
has
been
directed
toward
identifying
the
changes
which
occur
in
salivary
composition
in
response
to
exercise

To
address
this
,
our
article
first
refers
to
the
main
aspects
of
salivary
gland
physiology

A
knowledge
of
the
neural
control
of
salivary
secretion
is
especially
important
for
the
understanding
of
the
effects
of
exertion
on
salivary
secretion

Both
salivary
output
and
composition
depend
on
the
activity
of
the
autonomic
nervous
system
and
any
modification
of
this
activity
can
be
observed
indirectly
by
alternations
in
the
salivary
excretion

The
effects
of
physical
activity
(
with
reference
to
factors
such
as
exercise
intensity
and
duration
,
or
type
of
exercise
protocol
)
on
salivary
composition
are
then
considered

Exercise
might
indeed
induce
changes
in
several
salivary
components
such
as
immunoglobulins
,
hormones
,
lactate
,
proteins
and
electrolytes

Saliva
composition
might
therefore
be
used
as
an
alternative
noninvasive
indicator
of
the
response
of
the
different
body
tissues
and
systems
to
physical
exertion

In
this
respect
,
the
response
of
salivary
amylase
and
salivary
electrolytes
to
incremental
levels
of
exercise
is
of
particular
interest

Beyond
a
certain
intensity
of
exercise
,
and
coinciding
with
the
accumulation
of
blood
lactate
(
anaerobic
threshold
or
AT
)
,
a
'saliva
threshold
'
(
Tsa
)
does
indeed
exist

Tsa
is
the
point
during
exercise
at
which
the
levels
of
salivary
alpha-amylase
and
electrolytes
(
especially
Na+
)
also
begin
to
rise
above
baseline
levels

The
occurrence
of
the
2
thresholds
(
AT
and
Tsa
)
might
,
in
turn
,
be
attributable
to
the
same
underlying
mechanism
,
that
of
increased
adrenal
sympathetic
activity
at
high
exercise
intensities

Fat
is
an
extremely
important
substrate
for
muscle
contraction
,
both
at
rest
and
during
exercise

Triglycerides
(
TGs
)
,
stored
in
adipose
tissue
and
within
muscle
fibres
,
are
considered
to
be
the
main
source
of
the
free
fatty
acids
(
FFAs
)
oxidised
during
exercise

It
is
still
unclear
,
however
,
how
the
use
of
these
substrates
is
regulated
during
exercise

The
regulation
seems
to
be
multifactorial
and
includes
:
(
i
)
dietary
and
nutritional
status
;
(
ii
)
hormonal
milieu
;
(
iii
)
exercise
mode
,
intensity
and
duration
;
and
(
iv
)
training
status

On
the
other
hand
,
the
mechanism
for
FFA
transport
from
its
storage
as
triglycerides
in
adipose
tissue
and
muscle
to
its
place
of
utilisation
in
heart
,
skeletal
muscle
,
kidney
and
liver
is
more
clearly
understood

It
has
been
determined
that
the
plasma
FFA
turnover
rate
is
sufficiently
rapid
to
account
for
most
of
the
fat
metabolised
during
low
intensity
exercise
(
25
to
40
%
VO2max
)

However
,
an
exercise
intensity
of
65
%
VO2max
results
in
a
slight
decrease
in
the
amount
of
plasma
FFA
uptake
by
muscle
tissue

Other
studies
have
found
that
during
prolonged
exercise
,
muscle
TGs
become
the
predominant
source
of
energy
obtained
from
fat

Furthermore
,
it
is
widely
documented
that
endurance
activities
increase
the
energy
utilisation
from
fat
while
sparing
carbohydrate
sources

For
example
,
during
exercise
on
a
cycle
ergometer
,
nonplasma
FFAs
and
plasma
FFAs
contribute
40
%
,
and
carbohydrates
60
%
,
of
the
total
calculated
amount
of
energy
expenditure
before
exercise
and
vice
versa
after
exercise
(
60
%
nonplasma
and
plasma
FFAs
and
40
%
carbohydrates
)

Although
it
was
many
years
before
it
was
fully
demonstrated
,
fat
is
now
known
to
be
transported
in
the
blood
as
FFA
bound
to
the
protein
carrier
albumin

The
mobilisation
of
FFA
is
primarily
a
function
of
sympathetic
nervous
activity
directed
towards
the
adipocytes
,
or
the
'fat
pad
'
.
This
nervous
activity
can
be
direct
or
may
be
an
effect
of
circulating
catecholamines
such
as
adrenaline
(
epinephrine
)

This
article
summarises
the
role
of
fat
metabolism
during
exercise

As
the
clinical
availability
of
glycohaemoglobin/GHb
measurement
increases
,
so
does
the
need
for
comparable
and
accurate
values
among
different
laboratories
and
different
methods

At
least
there
should
be
comparability
,
i.e
.
,
commutability
or
feasibility
of
providing
comparable
results
from
different
assays
in
different
laboratories

A
clinical
joint
study
on
insulin
therapy
,
a
survey
of
the
actual
inter-laboratory
differences
in
GHb
measurement
among
41
institutions
and
an
assessment
of
11
assay
methods
for
the
determination
of
GHb
were
performed
using
commercial
calibrators
and
fresh
blood
samples

Data
on
the
actual
state
of
inter-laboratory
and
inter-assay
differences
of
observed
values
were
useful
for
comparing
results
among
facilities

The
recommendation
of
the
Japan
Diabetes
Society
to
measure
only
the
stable
GHb
component
and
to
correct
the
GHb
percentage
by
two-point
calibration
with
assigned
values
,
was
effective
but
not
sufficient

Even
after
correction
,
8
out
of
11
methods
still
remained
of
little
practical
use
because
of
their
large
relative
errors

Inter-method
differences
among
11
available
assay
methods
were
great
even
after
correction
and
depended
on
not
only
the
methods
but
the
samples
used
for
the
determination

The
performance
of
some
methods
or
instruments
used
are
only
poor
at
distinguishing
the
stable
glycated
haemoglobin
itself

Some
alternative
measurement
system
with
comparability
,
commutability
and
precision
should
be
established

An
urgent
and
worldwide
problem
to
remove
inter-laboratory
differences
in
the
measurement
of
GHb
needs
to
be
solved

Users
in
clinical
practice
must
recognize
these
problems
,
and
,
before
supply
,
the
providers
should
check
their
method
and
keep
records
that
are
readily
traceable

A
postal
survey
was
performed
to
determine
the
current
practices
and
attitudes
of
radiologists
towards
the
imaging
of
suspected
lower
limb
deep
vein
thrombosis
(
DVT
)

One
hundred
and
twenty-seven
departments
responded
to
a
questionnaire
sent
in
March
1996

The
results
show
that
87
%
of
hospitals
possess
colour
Doppler
ultrasound
(
CDUS
)
machines
and
that
46
%
of
departments
perform
ultrasound
as
the
first
line
investigation
in
over
90
%
of
cases

Thirty
per
cent
of
departments
considered
calf
vein
visualization
to
be
generally
adequate
and
34
%
thought
that
clinicians
in
their
hospitals
invariably
anticoagulated
patients
with
isolated
calf
thrombus

In
hospitals
where
venography
was
routinely
used
as
the
first
line
investigation
,
the
most
common
reasons
were
:
the
perceived
inferiority
of
ultrasound
(
US
)
in
demonstrating
below-knee
clot
,
its
time-consuming
nature
and
the
limited
access
to
suitable
ultrasound
machines

The
widespread
use
of
ultrasound
is
encouraging
,
however
,
there
are
clearly
diverse
views

of

3d
computer-assisted

of
the
internal

of
small
pulmonary
nodules
using
contrast-enhanced
dh-ct
was
found
to
be
effective
for
differentiating
between
benign

malignant
nodules

the
patient
was
a
62-year-old
man
with
squamous
cell
lung
cancer
,
which
was
first
successfully
treated
by
a
combination
of
radiation
therapy
and
chemotherapy
,
but
showed
local
recurrence
after
8
months

the
combination
of
txt
,
gem
and

may
be
effective
for
recurrent
non-small-cell
lung
carcinoma
,
even
in
patients
that
have
failed
to
respond
to
more
than
one
chemotherapy
regimen

the
aim
of
the
current
study
was
to
compare
the
objective
response
and
survival
rates
of
patients
with

treated
with
il-2
administered
either
systemically
(

subcutaneously
)
or
via
inhalation
(
inh
)
,
using
relatively
large
sample
sizes
to
afford
a
more
meaningful
comparison

conclusion
:
as
expected
,
the
type
of
chemotherapy
we
used
,
to
treat
non-seminomatous
germ-cell
tumors
proved
to
be
highly
effective
for
seminomatous
types
,
as
well

carboplatin

that
both

effective
at
suppressing
the
development

growth
of

orthotopic
tumors
using
this
protocol

despite
the
marked
toxicity
of
the
initial
intensive
chemotherapy
,
the
treatments
are
tolerable
and
effective
in
the
control
of

they
are
less
effective

effective
as
an
adjuvant
therapy
after

for
some
malignant
tumors
such
as

cancer

moreover
,
uft
has
proved
to
be
effective
for
inoperable

malignancies
such
as

cancer
,
especially
in

,
fractionated

conclusion
:
our
results
suggest
that

plus
acetaminophen
is
effective
for
relief
of
symptoms
attributable
to
the
paranasal
sinuses
that
may
develop
early
in

course
of

cold

reviewer
's
conclusions
:
a
single
dose
of
nasal
decongestant
in
the
common
cold
is
moderately
effective
for
the
short
term
relief
of
congestion
in
adults
,
while
there
is
no
evidence
available
to
show
benefit
after

are
very
likely
to
seek

could
be
an
effective
and

conclusions
:
the

the

,
except
in
1
patient
treated

silicone
stents
were
used

tracheobronchial
stenoses

results
:
all
patients
experienced
improvement
of

of
both
dysphagia
and
respiratory

conclusions
:
for
patients
with
both
esophageal
and
tracheobronchial
stenoses
,
a
stent
should
be
introduced
into
the
tracheobronchus
first

because
placement
of
stents
in
both
the
esophagus
and
tracheobronchus
has
a
high
risk
of
enlargement
of
the
fistula
,
a
covered

stent
is
preferable
for

:
the
purpose
of
this
retrospective

was
to
compare
the
effectiveness
of
gamma

objective
:
careful
patient
selection
is
vital
when
video-assisted
thoracoscopic
surgical

is
considered

we
reviewed
our
vats
experience
for
therapeutic
metastasectomy
of
peripheral

pulmonary
metastases

methods
:
over
90
months
,
therapeutic
vats
metastasectomy
was
accomplished
upon
80
patients
with
colorectal
metastases

conclusions
:
therapeutic
vats
resection
of
colorectal
metastases
appears
efficacious

objectives
:
to
review
the
spectrum
of
presentation
and
the
surgical
management
of
non
small

lung
cancer
(
nsclc

and
the
role
of
various
diagnostic
modalities
in
predicting
the
post-operative

and
the
correlation
of
the
post-operative
stage
with
the
chances
of

patients
with
limited-stage
small-cell
carcinoma
of
the
lung
are
treated
with
combined-modality
therapy
with
the
intent
to
cure

in
the
past
several
years
,
new
chemotherapeutic
agents
,
including
the
taxanes
and
the
topoisomerase
i
inhibitors
,
have
demonstrated
substantial
activity
against
small-cell
carcinoma

we
evaluated
the
role
of
chemotherapy
for
patients
with
brain
metastases
from
nsclc

methods
:
we
analyzed
30
patients
who
were
discovered
to
have
brain
metastases
during
the
diagnosis
of
121
patients
enrolled
in
three
consecutive
clinical
trials
on
advanced
nsclc
assessing
combination
chemotherapy
of
cisplatin
,
ifosfamide
and
irinotecan
with
rhg-csf
support

conclusions
:
both
the
response
rate
and
survival
data
in
this
retrospective
study
suggest
a
high
degree
of
activity
of
this
combination
chemotherapy
in
patients
with
brain
metastases
from
nsclc

the
aim
of
this
study
was
the
evaluation
of
both
the
antitumour
activity
and
toxicity
of
an
immunochemotherapeutic
regimen
consisting
of
interferon-alpha2b
and
interleukin-2
in
combination
with
fotemustine
for
patients

and
its
correlation
with

and
patient
survival
,
we
undertook
the
present
study
in
20
small
cell
lung
cancer
(
sclc
)
patients

in
patients
with
metastatic
colorectal
cancer
,
intravenous
oxaliplatin
has
been
trialled
as
a
monotherapy
and
in
combination
with
other
agents

neoadjuvant
therapy
with
oxaliplatin/fluorouracil/folinic
acid
has
proven
beneficial
in
enabling
surgical
removal
of
previously
unresectable
liver
metastases

in
2
studies
,
surgery
with
curative
intent
was
performed
in
16
and
51
%
of
patients
with
initially
unresectable
liver
metastases
following
oxaliplatin/fluorouracil/folinic
acid
therapy
;
the
5-year
survival
rates
were
40
and
50
%
,
respectively

in
patients
with
advanced
ovarian
cancer
,
first-line
therapy
with
oxaliplatin/cyclophosphamide
achieved
an
objective
response
rate
which
did
not
differ
significantly
from
that
of
cisplatin/cyclophosphamide
(
33
vs
42
%
)

in
addition
,
oxaliplatin
has
shown
efficacy
in
patients
with
platinum-pretreated
ovarian
cancer
and
achieved
objective
response
rates
similar
to
paclitaxel
in
this
setting
(
16
vs
17
%
)

promising
results
have
also
been
found
with
oxaliplatin
in
patients
with
non-hodgkin
's
lymphoma
,
breast
cancer
,
mesothelioma
and
non-small
cell
lung
cancer

conclusion
:
oxaliplatin
in
combination
with
fluorouracil/folinic
acid
is
an
effective
treatment
option
for
patients
with
metastatic
colorectal
cancer
,
both
as
a
first-line
therapy
and
in
patients
refractory
to
previous
chemotherapy

additional
clinical
investigation
of
oxaliplatin
in
patients
with
other
cancers
is
warranted
given
the
promising
results
achieved
in
early
trials
,
most
notably
in
patients
with
platinum-pretreated
ovarian
cancer

combined
modality
treatment
has
'come

and
increasingly
represents
standard
of
care
for
a
rapidly
growing
number
of

infiltration
of
primary
tumor
(

in
patients
who
undergo

conclusions
:
lymph

immunoreactivity
and
li
significantly
influence
long
term
survival
after
curative
surgery
for
patients
with

,
which
accounts
for
approximately
20
%
of
cases
of

,
the
primary

is
chemotherapy
and
in
the

the
primary
aim
is
to
control
the
disease
which
generally
would
have
spread
beyond
the

a
growing
body
of
evidence
suggests
that
postoperative
irradiation
for
non-small

lung
cancer
may
cause
life-threatening
toxicity
and
,
when
the
risk
of
local-regional
recurrence
is
low
,
the
toxicity
of
irradiation
may
outweight
the
benefit

purpose
:
this
randomized

was
designed
to
determine
whether

a
survival
advantage
over

conclusion
:
pc
is
equally
efficacious
as

cancer

purpose
:
a
prospective
randomized
trial
in

was
performed
to
determine
if
intensification
of
the
platinum
dose
by
giving
cisplatin
and
carboplatin
in
combination
to
patients
with
sclc
yields
higher
response
rates
and
survival
,
than
carboplatin
alone
in
a
combination
chemotherapy
regimen

conclusions
:
the
intensification
of
platinum
dose
(
cisplatin

chemotherapy
significantly
increased
the
complete
response
rate
,
overall
survival
and
number
of
two-year
survivors
among
sclc
patients
with
limited
disease
compared
to

therapy
with
carboplatin
alone
,
suggesting
that
a
more
aggressive
treatment
to
this
category
of
patients
is
worthwhile
,
while
no
difference
in
treatment
outcome
was
observed
for
patients

confirmed
the

depending
on
the
outcome
of

,
amifostine
may
eventually
find

These

suggest
that

Chemotherapy
may
be
an
alternative

Three
patients
in
whom
splenomegaly
was
detected
during
their

evaluation
underwent
splenectomy

This
study
indicates
that
BAM-M
is
effective
therapy
for
advanced
stage
mycosis
fungoides
and
suggests
that
the
therapeutic
role
of
splenectomy
should
be
evaluated
further

Only

have
eradicated
these
micrometastases
in
the
older
children
,
since
the
age

Traditional
therapy
for
malignant
pleural
effusions
includes
thoracentesis
or
tube
drainage
with
instillation
of
irritants
to
achieve
pleurodesis

We
feel
that
pleuroperitoneal
shunting
is
a
valid
new
method
for
treatment
of
malignant
pleural
effusions
which
can
effectively
palliate
respiratory
symptoms
with
low
morbidity

When
right
ventricular
failure
prohibits
separation
from
cardiopulmonary
bypass
,
standard
methods
of
increasing
pulmonary
blood
flow
should
be
employed
,
including
correction
of
hypoxia
and
acidosis
,
volume
loading
,
and
inotropic
support
of
the
right
ventricle

For
refractory
right
ventricular
failure
following
the
surgical
repair
of
congenital
cardiac
defects
in
which
the
placement
of
right
atrial
and
pulmonary
artery
cannulae
is
not
technically
feasible
,
use
of
high-frequency
high-volume
ventilation
appears
to
be
quite
promising

Current
results
suggest
that
RHBP
remains
the
gold
standard
for
severe
RV
failure
,
but
further
clinical
experience
with
PABC
may
more
clearly
define
its
role
in
the
management
of
RV
failure

Guiding
surgical
therapy
of
ventricular

necessitates
improvement
of
the

site

However
,
the
results
of
this
study
indicate
that
procainamide
may
be
effective
in
suppressing
the
induction
of
sustained
ventricular
tachycardia
at
a
relatively
low
plasma
concentration
,
but
not
at

26
%
(

)
of
all
the

Initial
empiric
therapy
for
community-acquired
bacterial
meningitis
should
be
based
on
the
possibility
that
penicillin-resistant
pneumococci
may
be
the
etiologic
organisms
and
,
hence
,
should
include
a
combination
of
third-generation
cephalosporin
(
cefotaxime
or
ceftriaxone
)
and
vancomycin

Ampicillin
should
be
included
if
the
patient
has
predisposing
factors
that
are
associated
with
a
risk
for
infection
with
Listeria
monocytogenes

Results
of
clinical
trials
and

suggest
that
dexamethasone
therapy
improves
the
outcome
for
patients

Inchinko-to
(
TJ-135
)
is
a
herbal
medicine
consisting
of
three
kinds
of
crude
drugs
,
and
in
Japan
it
is
administered
mainly
to
patients
with
cholestasis

The
present
study
evaluated
the
effects
of
TJ-135
on
concanavalin
A
(
con
A
)
-induced
hepatitis
in
mice
in

and
con
A-induced

These
results
suggest
that
con
A-induced
hepatitis
was
ameliorated
by
pretreatment
with
TJ-135

Therefore
administration
of
TJ-135
may
be
useful
in
patients
with
severe
acute
hepatitis
accompanying
cholestasis
or
in
those
with
autoimmune

Traditionally
,
the
therapy
of

is
based
on
antibiotics
,
antibronchoobstructive
medication
,
and
chest
physical
therapy

Bilateral

should
be
considered
in

Prospective

supporting
any
of
the
different

strategies
are
not
available
,
but
antibiotics
and

OBJECTIVES
:
Interest
in
zinc
as
a
treatment
for
the
common
cold
has
grown
following
the
recent
publication
of
several
controlled
trials

The
objective
of
this
review
was
to
assess
the
effects
of
zinc
lozenges
for
cold
symptoms

Results
from
two
trials
(
04
-
Mossad
;
08
-
Smith
)
suggested
zinc
lozenges
reduced
the
severity
and
duration
of
cold
symptoms

Given
the
potential
for
treatment
to
produce
side
effects
,
the
use
of
zinc
lozenges
to
treat
cold
symptoms
deserves
further
study

,
presented
with
severe

Although
hepatic

due
to
metastatic

is
extremely
rare
,
transcatheter

)
is
an
appropriate
and

The
surgical

trauma

BACKGROUND
:
An
increasing
number
of
reports
indicate
symptomatic
relief
of
biliary
colic
symptoms
after
cholecystectomy
for
biliary
dyskinesia

Despite
this
,
cholecystectomy
as
a
treatment
for
biliary
dyskinesia
remains
controversial

Our
aim
was
to
determine
efficacy
of
cholecystectomy
in
alleviating
biliary
dyskinesia
symptoms
and
the
correlation
with
histologic
findings

CONCLUSIONS
:
Biliary
dyskinesia
patients
who
underwent
cholecystectomy
had
significantly
greater
symptom
improvement
compared
with
nonsurgical
patients

Cholecystectomy
should
be
a
first-line
therapy
for
biliary
dyskinesia
patients

Transbronchial
biopsy
revealed
inflammatory
nonspecific
alveolar
lesions
suggestive
of
bronchiolitis
obliterans
organizing
pneumonia
,
which
responded
well
clinically
and
radiologically
to
oral
corticosteroids

Novel
treatment
strategies
for
patients
with
advanced
NSCLC
may
involve
chemotherapy
combined
with
inhibition
of
NF-kappaB-dependent
cell-survival
pathways

Effectiveness
of
pseudoephedrine
plus
acetaminophen

OBJECTIVE
:
This
retrospective
study
was
designed
to
confirm
that
aggressive
pulmonary
resection
can
provide
effective
long-term
palliation
of
disease
for
patients
with
pulmonary
aspergilloma

METHODS
AND
RESULTS
:
From
1959
to
1998
,
84
patients
underwent
a
total
of
90
operations
for
treatment
of
pulmonary
aspergilloma
in
the
Marie-Lannelongue
Hospital

The
lesion
was
resected
by
video-assisted
thoracoscopic
surgery
because
it
was
suspected
of
being
a
lung
abscess
that
had
caused
repeated
episodes
of
inflammation

In
this
study
,
we
investigated
the
expression
and
therapeutic
potential
of
TRAIL
in
cholangiocarcinoma
,
one
of
the
most
devastating
human
hepatic
malignancies

Finally
,
in
vivo
administration
of
recombinant
TRAIL
substantially
inhibited
subcutaneous
tumor
growth
of
human
cholangiocarcinoma
cells

Induction
of
apoptosis
in
tumor
cells
is
possible
with
a
biologically
active
TRAIL
,
and
suggests
that
this
cytokine
is
a
promising
antitumor
agent
against
human
cholangiocarcinoma

Interferon
plays
a
critical
role
in
the
host
's
natural
defense
against
viral
infections
and
in
their
treatment

This
study
investigated
whether
intensive
chemotherapy
might
have
a
positive
effect
on
asthma
in
these
special
cases
and
whether
asthma
generally
relapses
after
completion
of
chemotherapy

The
authors
monitored
clinical
outcome
and
lung
function
of
43
children
with
acute

leukemia
and
non-Hodgkin
lymphoma
who
received
chemotherapy
at
the
University
Children
's
Hospital
of
Greifswald
between
1993
and
1998

She
was
diagnosed
as

PURPOSE
:
Inhaled

have
only
a
minor
short-term
effect

Thus
,
s-ECP
appears
to
be
a
useful
marker
for
determining
when
a
step-down
in

is
indicated
,
and
thus
may
contribute

would
facilitate

programs

Therefore
,
it
can
be
concluded
that
with
two
injections
of
the
high-dose
hepatitis
A
and
B
vaccine
,
6
months

,
a

CONCLUSIONS
:
These

,
the
first

can
inhibit
the

PURPOSE
:
Macrolide
antibiotics
are
frequently
prescribed
to
patients
with
symptoms
of
a
common
cold

Because
the
symptoms
of
rhinovirus
colds
are
attributed
to
the
inflammatory
response
to
infection
,
we
studied
the
effects
of
treatment
with
clarithromycin
on
the
symptomatic
and
inflammatory
response
to
nasal
inoculation
with
rhinovirus

Therapeutic

applied
with
the
same
success
in

In
conclusion
,
in
some
cases
of
MDR
TB
,
the
TP
(
if
there
are
no
pleural
adherences
)
may
lead
to

should
be
effective

All
children
with
croup
symptoms
who
demonstrate
increased

in
the
clinics
or

should
be
treated
with
glucocorticoids

Increasing
resistance
among
the
common
respiratory
pathogens
has
encouraged
assessment
of
alternative
agents
,
for
example
,
levofloxacin

Unlike
earlier
quinolones
,
levofloxacin
has
excellent
activity
against
Streptococcus
pneumoniae
,
including
strains
resistant
to
penicillin

Clinical
trials
show
levofloxacin
to
be
as
effective
as
cephalosporins
in
acute
exacerbation
of
chronic
bronchitis
and
as
effective
as
co-amoxiclav
,
cephalosporins
or
amoxycillin
in
community-acquired
pneumonia

Additionally

was
carried
out
to

days
after
the
inhalation
of
a
mouse-adopted
strain
of

From
these
results
Gingyo-san
was
shown
to
be
an
antiviral
agent
in

infected
with
a
lethal
amount
of
a

The
purpose
of
the
present
study
was
to
analyze
the
association
of
recurrent
abdominal
pain
and
H.
pylori
infection
in
children
and
to
evaluate
the
efficacy
of
antimicrobial
treatment
in
patients
with
evidence
of
infection

Patients
with
evidence
of
infection
with
H.
pylori
were
treated
with
a
combination
of
omeprazole
,
amoxicillin
,
and
clarithromycin

Treatment
with
omeprazole
,
amoxicillin
,
and
clarithromycin
resulted
in
eradication
of
the
infection
in
all
and
in
resolution
of
the
clinical
symptoms
in
15
(
80
%
)
of
19
patients
who
had
a
follow-up
examination

A
combined
therapy
results
in
eradication
of
the
bacterium
and
in
improvement
of
the
clinical
symptoms
in
a
significant
majority
of
the
patients

In
certain

settings
,
interventional

;
techniques
include
percutaneous

BACKGROUND
:
The
administration
of
salbutamol
is
permitted
only
by

by
the
International
Olympic
Committee
(
IOC
)
for
the
management
of

Urine
was
also
obtained
from
subjects
who
had
received
the
maximum
dosage
of
inhaled
salbutamol
advisable
for
competing
athletes
to
provide
protection
from
exercise-induced

OBJECTIVE
:
to
evaluate
the
possible
existence
of
the
so-called
<
Roux-en-Y
syndrome
>
in
a
group
of
21
patients
who
underwent

gastritis

All
had
undergone
Billroth
II
subtotal
gastrectomy
(
20
for
ulcer
and
1
for
gastric
cancer
)

CONCLUSIONS
:
we
found
no
evidence
of
disturbances
in
gastric
remnant
emptying
after
Roux-en-Y
gastrojejunostomy
to
treat
postoperative
alkaline
gastric
reflux

BACKGROUND
:
Drainage
methods
for
the
gastric
conduit
after
esophagectomy
for
carcinoma
have
been
controversial

CONCLUSIONS
:
This
study
indicates
that
the
use
of
a
computerized
physician
reminder
and
a
mailed
patient
reminder
had
a
positive
impact
on
influenza
immunizations
for
older

Contemporary
asthma
management
guidelines
list
inhaled
corticosteroids
as
the
preferred
controller
medication
for
patients
with
persistent
asthma

Fluticasone
propionate
is
one
of
several
inhaled
corticosteroids
used
for
the
treatment
of
asthma

A
series
of
comparative
analyses
show
that
inhaled
fluticasone
propionate
is
more
cost
effective
than
oral
zafirlukast
and
triamcinolone
acetonide
and
slightly
more
cost
effective
than
flunisolide
in
adult
patients
with
asthma

Quality-of-life
assessments
in
patients
with
mild
to
moderate
disease
show
that
inhaled
fluticasone
propionate
achieved
improvements
which
were
deemed
to
be
clinically
meaningful
in
patients
with
mild
to
moderate
asthma
;
these
changes
were
significantly
greater
than
those
achieved
with
oral
zafirlukast
,
inhaled
triamcinolone
acetonide
or
placebo

CONCLUSIONS
:
In
addition
to
the
considerable
body
of
clinical
evidence
supporting
the
use
of
inhaled
fluticasone
propionate
in
patients
with
asthma
,
accumulating
short
term
cost-effectiveness
data
also
suggest
that
this
agent
can
be
administered
for
a
similar
or
lower
cost
per
outcome
than
other
inhaled
corticosteroids
or
oral
zafirlukast

Importantly
,
the
clinical
benefits
offered
by
fluticasone
propionate
in
patients
with
persistent
asthma
are
accompanied
by
clinically
significant
improvements
in
quality
of
life

OBJECTIVE
:
To
describe
the
effect
of

Combination
therapy
with
interferon-alpha
(
IFN
alpha
)
plus
Ribavirin
has
been
shown
to
improve
the
response
rate
in
patients
with
chronic
hepatitis
C
as
compared
to
IFN
alpha
alone

To
prove
,
whether
Ribavirin
has
any
additional
effect
on
the
decline
of
hepatitis
C
viremia
during
the
first
weeks
of
treatment
patients
with
and
without
combination
therapy
were
compared

In
patients
with
combination
therapy
,
a
further
reduction
of
viremia
level
could
be
observed
,
whereas
viremia
levels
in
patients
with
IFN
alpha
alone
slightly
increased

Ribavirin
in
combination
with
IFN
alpha
exerts
an
additional
anti-viral/immunmodulatory
effect
which
manifests
itself
in
phase
2
of

to
the

OBJECTIVE
:
The
aim
of
these
studies
was
to
compare
the
pharmacokinetics
of

(
FP
)
after
repeated
administration
via
the
Diskus
or
Diskhaler
dry

)
to
patients
with
mild-to-moderate

CONCLUSION
:
In
patients
with
asthma
receiving
repeated
inhaled
doses
of
FP
,
the
systemic
exposure
(
AUC
)
after
inhalation
from
the
Diskus
was
similar
to
that
from
the

,
with
no

CONCLUSIONS
:
Amoxicillin

it
seems
that
inhaled

We
observed
the

METHODS
:
Thirty-seven

history
of
constipation
(
i.e
.
,
pain
and
difficulty
or
delay
in

for
>
3
months
)
were
recruited
and
randomly
assigned
to
8
weeks
of
treatment
with
either
cisapride
,
0.2
mg/kg

Patient
1
demonstrated
dramatic
clearing
of
his
MCV
lesions
when
intravenous
cidofovir
therapy
was
started
for
his
treatment-resistant
bilateral
CMV
retinitis
and
because
of
cidofovir
's
possible
activity
against
MCV

In
case

,
cidofovir
was
compounded
as
a
3
%
cream
in
a
combination
vehicle
(
Dermovan
)
for
extensive
facial
involvement
,
and
complete
resolution
of
MCV
was
seen
after
1
month
of
therapy

In
case
3
,
intravenous
cidofovir
therapy
was
started
both
for
CMV
retinitis
and
in
an
attempt
to
clear
90
%
facial
MCV
involvement
;
after
1
month
of
treatment
,
all
clinical
evidence
of
MCV
had
resolved

CONCLUSIONS
:
Cidofovir
,
a
nucleotide
analog
of
deoxycytidine
monophosphate
,
appears
to
have
contributed
to
clearing
of
advanced
MCV
lesions
in
these
3
patients
,
thus
providing
suggestive
evidence
of
clinical
activity
against
MCV

Controlled

We
conclude
that

CASE
SUMMARY
:
A
92-year
old
white
woman
who
was
receiving
venlafaxine
for
management
of
depression
was
found
to
have
hyponatremia

Touch

was
assessed
with
von

in
the
breasts
of
10
healthy
women
(

)
and
of
80
women
with
breast
cancer
who
at
least
1
year
previously
had
undergone
subcutaneous
mastectomy
and
immediate
reconstruction
with
a
prosthesis

Although
improved
glycemic
control
,
maintenance
of
normal
blood
pressure
,
and
use
of
angiotensin-converting
enzyme
inhibitors
are
important
strategies
to
avoid
developing
microalbuminuria
,
dietary
macronutrient
intake
may
also
play
a
role

Local
injection
of
corticosteroids
into

)
,
methotrexate
(

CONCLUSIONS
:
Malnourished
patients
with
chronic

PURPOSE
:
We

MATERIALS
AND
METHODS
:
From

RESULTS
:
Tubularized

CONCLUSIONS
:
Tubularized

urethroplasty
is
a
versatile
operation
that
corrects

BACKGROUND
:
The
growing
use
of

,
coupled
with
the

,
emphasizes
the

CONCLUSION
:
Direct

may
be
performed
safely
as
an
alternative
to

OBJECTIVES
:
The
purpose
of
this
analysis
was
to
determine
the
influence
of
an
additional
treatment
delay
inherent
in
transfer
to
an

center
for
primary
angioplasty
of
patients
with
acute

who
are

facilities

BACKGROUND
:
Several
randomized
trials
have
demonstrated
the
benefits
of
primary
angioplasty
in
acute
myocardial

We
report
the
first
case
(

As
the
overview
shows
,
both
groups
of
substances
are
useful
for
individualized
treatment
of
benign
prostatic
hyperplasia
(
BPH
)
,
provided
that
conservative
pharmacological
treatment
of
BPH
is
basically
accepted
and
that
the
patients
'
quality
of
life
is
also
considered

The
results
of
several
clinical
investigations
showed
the
efficacy
and
safety
of
artichoke
extracts
(
Cynara
scolymus
L.
)
in
the
treatment
of
hepato-biliary
dysfunction
and
digestive
complaints
,
such
as
sensation
of
fullness
,
loss
of
appetite
,
nausea
and
abdominal
pain

Besides
the
well-known
nonsteroidal
antiinflammatory
drugs
(
NSAID
)
for
the
treatment
of
rheumatic
pain
herbal
medicine
can
also
be
applied
successfully

Extracts
of
the
secondary

)
are
recommended
for
the
supportive
treatment
of

High-dose
intravenous
immunoglobulin
(
hdIVIg
)
is
increasingly
used
to
treat
a
range
of
inflammatory
and
autoimmune
diseases

The
current
dermatological
uses
of
hdIVIg
include
the
treatment
of
dermatomyositis
and
the
autoimmune
bullous
disorders
,
epidermolysis
bullosa
acquisita
,
pemphigoid
,
and
pemphigus

Unfortunately
,
current
dermatological
uses
of
hdIVIg
have
been
limited
to
either
uncontrolled
trials
or
anecdotal
case
reports
,
except
for
a
single
controlled
trial
of
hdIVIg
as
adjunctive
therapy
in
patients
with
dermatomyositis
,
which
documented
a
significant
benefit

We
describe
a

OBJECTIVE
AND
IMPORTANCE
:
The
use
of
chronic
intrathecal
morphine
for
the
treatment
of
intractable

nonmalignant
pain
is
becoming
more
prevalent

METHODS
:

The
growing
use
of
automated
night-time
dialysis
(
APD
)
in
peritoneal
dialysis

this
method
represents
a
valid

La
Serna
et
al
.
(
Lancet
1987
;
26
:
1517
)
were
the
first
to
treat
adults
with
recurrent
pericarditis
with
colchicine
,
and
were
followed
by
other
authors

While
these
findings
are
observed
for
all
classes
of
oral
drugs
,
the
issue
is
especially
critical
for
cancer
chemotherapy
,
in
which
a
narrow
therapeutic
index
is
frequently
observed

Treatment
for
low-grade
NHL
during
the
past
30
yr
has
consisted
of
high-dose
radiation
and
cytotoxic
agents
,
administered
alone
or
in
combination
,
and
high-dose
therapy
with
stem
cell
transplant

However
,
recent
clinical
use
of
monoclonal
antibodies
(
mAbs
)
in
patients
with
low-grade
or
transformed
low-grade
NHL
has
resulted
in
less
toxicity
than
conventional
treatments
,
as
well
as
response
rates
that
are
comparable
or
superior
to
those
achieved
with
chemotherapy

Therefore
,
interest
is
growing
in
mAbs
as
therapeutic
alternatives
for
patients
with
low-grade
NHL
and
those
with
transformed
histology

CONCLUSION
:
The
treatment
paradigm
for
NHL
is
expected
to
change
over
the
next
few
years
to
include
radiolabeled
mAbs
,
administered
alone
or
in
combination
with
cytotoxic
agents

RESULTS
:
Clinical
trials
of
UFT
published
in
the
Western

The
activity
of
oral
UFT
in
large-bowel
cancer
when
administered
with
oral
LV
(
approximately
50
mg/dose
)
has
resulted
in

:
UFT
is
a
fluoropyrimidine
active
in
colorectal
cancer

As
concomitant
thrombocytosis
persisted
despite
treatment
with
hydroxyurea
,
the
new
megakaryocyte
inhibitor
anagrelide
(
Agrelin
)

administered
and

normalization
of
the

count

11
days

For
a
subset
of
patients
with
Kaposi
's
sarcoma
who
were
treated
with
recombinant
interferon
alfa-2a
,
the
disease
is
in
complete
remission
,
without
opportunistic
infection
,
and
they
appear
to
be
culture-negative
for
the
etiologic
retrovirus
that
causes
their
immune
deficiency

Interferon
alfa-2a
appears
to
have
antineoplastic
efficacy
,
(
and
may
have
antiretroviral
efficacy
as
well
)
in
this
epidemic
neoplasm

In
three
consecutive
Phase
II
trials
of
recombinant
interferon
alfa-2a
(
rIFN
alfa-2a
;
Roferon-A
Hoffmann-La
Roche
,
Nutley
,
NJ
)
involving
96
patients
with
advanced
malignant
melanoma
,
an
overall
response
rate
of
22
%
was
observed

As
single
agent
therapy
in
malignant
melanoma
,
interferon
alfa-2a
was
only
marginally
useful
in
most
patients

Studies
with
various
interferon
alpha
preparations
,
including
interferons
induced
in
human
leukocytes
,
interferon
alfa-N1
,
interferon
alfa-2a
,
and
interferon
alfa-2b
,
have
all
provided
evidence
for
modest
but
reproducible
antitumor
activity
in
advanced
renal
cell
carcinoma

Preliminary
evidence
suggests
that
interferons
beta
and
gamma
may
also
induce
regression
of
metastatic
renal
cell
carcinoma

The
rationale
for
antileukemic
therapy
in
hairy
cell
leukemia
is
to
reduce
the
significant
risk
of
infection
and
other
potential
serious
complications

Splenectomy
presumably
alleviates
the
pancytopenic
effect
of
hypersplenism
by
removing
the
preferred
site
of
leukemic
cell
proliferation

Recombinant
and
natural
forms
of
interferon
alpha
have
been
shown
to
bring
about
tumor
regressions
in
patients
with
low-grade
non-Hodgkin
's
lymphoma

Current
studies
using
interferon
in
patients
with
low-grade
non-Hodgkin
's
lymphomas
are
evaluating
lower
,
and
perhaps
better
tolerated
doses
of
interferon

This
approach
is
being
extended
to
the
clinic
,
and
trials
are
now
underway
evaluating
combinations
of
interferon
and
various
cytotoxic
drugs
known
from
previous
studies
to
be
active
in
patients
with
low-grade
non-Hodgkin
's
lymphomas

While
the
demonstrated
antiviral
,
antiproliferative
,
and
immunomodulatory
properties
of
interferons
have
led
to
a
number
of
theories
regarding
their
potential
use
in
treating
individuals
with
chronic
myelogenous
leukemia
(
CML
)
,
their
limited
availability
has
prevented
thorough
clinical
investigation

The
data
resulting
from
these
clinical
trials
indicate
that
interferon
alfa-2a
is
effective
in
inducing
hematologic
remissions
in
the
majority
of
minimally
treated
,
benign-phase
CML
,
Ph1-positive
patients

More
than
1600
patients
with
neoplastic
disorders
have
received
recombinant
human
interferon
alfa-2a
(
Roferon-A
,
Hoffmann-La
Roche
,
Nutley
,
NJ
)
as
part
of
ongoing
or
completed
clinical
trials

PURPOSE
:
A
phase
I/II
trial
of
docetaxel
,
cisplatin
,
fluorouracil
(
5-FU
)
,
and
leucovorin
(
TPFL5
)
induction
chemotherapy
for
patients
with
locally
advanced
squamous
cell
carcinoma
of
the
head
and
neck
(
SCCHN
)

PATIENTS
AND
METHODS
:
Twenty-three
previously

patients
with
stage
III
or
IV
SCCHN
and
Eastern
Cooperative
Oncology
Group
functional
status
less

OBJECTIVE
:
We
report
the
results
of
a
double-blind
,
double-dummy
,
active-control
study
designed
to
evaluate
the
efficacy
and
safety
of
lamotrigine
(
LTG
)
administered
as
monotherapy
to
adult
outpatients
with
partial
seizures

BACKGROUND
:
The
effectiveness
of
LTG
as
add-on
therapy
for
partial
seizures
in
adults
has
previously
been
established

CONCLUSIONS
:
We
conclude
that
LTG
is
effective
and
well
tolerated
when
administered
as
monotherapy
in
adult
patients
with
partial
seizures

BACKGROUND
:
Omega3

The
present
study
was
performed
to
examine
whether
omega3
fatty
acids
also
exhibit
mood-stabilizing
properties
in
bipolar
disorder

CONCLUSION
:
Omega3
fatty
acids
were
well
tolerated
and
improved
the
short-term
course
of
illness
in
this
preliminary
study
of
patients
with
bipolar
disorder
